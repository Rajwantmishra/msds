https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma	Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that occurs in the basal cells of the epidermis - the outermost layer of the skin. Basal cells constantly divide to replace dead or damaged skin cells closer to the outer surface of the epidermis. However, these cells can become cancerous when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation or other factors, triggering them to proliferate uncontrollably. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer with nearly 2.8 million Americans affected every year. | Basal cell carcinoma is usually found on the head and neck, but can be found anywhere on the body, including the limbs. Unlike more aggressive cancers, basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads, or metastasizes, to other sites within the body. Timely treatment and removal are key interventions to avoiding deformity of the affected area, and spread into deeper tissues. This cancer is fully treatable if detected early, but the chance of reoccurrence in the same area or other areas of the body is high.	" | Like all cancers, basal cell carcinoma is a result of errors, or mutations, in the DNA of affected cells.  While some mutations are harmless, others dismantle the cellular pathways that control cell proliferation. In the absence of tight controls, cells overgrow to form tumors. The main cause of DNA damage in basal cell carcinoma is prolonged exposure to UV light from the sun. UV radiation is also believed to block DNA repair proteins, further allowing the proliferation of mutant cells. The following risk factors are associated with basal cell carcinoma: | UV Radiation. Of the three types of UV radiation (A, B, and C), UVB radiation is linked to skin cancers. Chronic exposure to UV radiation from the sun or tanning beds, especially before the age of 18, increases the chance of developing basal cell carcinoma. Living in the sunny regions of the globe is also associated with a higher risk.
  Other radiation. Exposure to X-rays (used to treat some skin conditions) can cause basal cell carcinoma.
  Gene mutation. Mutations in the genes of specific proteins are linked to basal cell carcinoma. These include mutations in the tumor suppressor proteins p53 (TP53) and patched homologue 1 (PTCH1); sonic hedgehog (SHH); and smoothened (SMO).
  Arsenic. Exposure to arsenic, a toxic metal, through ingesting contaminated water or farming and refinery occupations, can cause basal cell carcinoma.
  Skin color. Light-skinned individuals absorb a greater amount of the damaging UV rays from the sun and, therefore, carry a greater risk for skin cancers.
  Age and gender. Basal cell carcinoma is common in individuals over the age of 50, and more so in men.
  Immune suppressive therapy. Basal cell carcinoma can form in patients on immuno-suppressant drugs following an organ transplant, or due to other medical conditions.
  Personal and family history. Once an individual has been diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, they have much greater chance of developing it a second time. A family history of the cancer is also associated with higher risk.
  Inherited syndromes. Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome) and xeroderma pigmentosum are rare inherited diseases that increase susceptibility to basal cell carcinoma."	"Basal cell carcinomas are most often found on the face, neck, and scalp; however, a physician should also examine any unusual bumps and sores in other areas of the body. A basal cell carcinoma may display the following symptoms: | A white to yellow, waxy growth with visible blood vessels
  A pink, skin-colored, or brown growth with a flat center
  A sore with a sunken center that bleeds easily and does not heal
  A sore that oozes or crusts over."	"In order to diagnose a basal cell carcinoma, the physician examines the affected area and removes a sample (biopsy) for additional evaluation. Once a positive diagnosis is made, the following treatment options are available: | Excision. Depending on the size of the carcinoma, surgery is used to cut and remove the affected cells, as well as some of the surrounding healthy cells. Minor reconstructive surgery is often required to repair the appearance of the treated area.
  Electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&C). In this procedure, small carcinomas on the ear and leg are scraped away and remaining cancerous cells are killed using electricity.
  Cryosurgery. Thin cancers that occur on the skin surface can be frozen (killed) using liquid nitrogen.
  Mohs surgery. In this technique, a thin layer of cells is removed and examined under a microscope for the cancer phenotype. These steps are repeated until only healthy cells are observed. Mohs surgery is a precise and effective way to remove large, deep carcinomas, without removing an excessive amount healthy tissue.
  Radiation. X-ray beams can be used to kill basal cell carcinoma cells. This method is very effective but carries the associated risk of additional exposure to radiation.
  Topical creams. When excision is not an option, topical drugs are used to locally treat basal cell carcinomas. For example, imiquimod and fluorouracil destroy cancer cells by using the body’s own immune system and interfering with DNA replication, respectively.
  Oral therapy. Vismodegib is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma. It is an oral drug that inhibits proliferation of basal cell carcinomas."	"The best way to prevent basal cell carcinoma is by minimizing exposure to harmful radiation from the sun and other sources. | Avoid the midday sun (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.).
  Wear sunscreen with broad UVA/UVB protection.
  Cover exposed skin with protective clothing.
  Tanning in direct sun or tanning beds is not advisable. | Routine self-examination of the skin for abnormal growth and sores is critical, especially for individuals with a high risk for basal cell carcinoma."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer	"Bladder cancer is a cancer that occurs in the bladder - the balloon-shaped organ that collects urine until it is excreted. It is caused by an uncontrolled growth of cells that form lumps called tumors. While some tumors are harmless, others continue to grow and eventually invade other organs. Bladder cancer is characterized by its location and growth through the four layers of the bladder wall. These include: | Urothelium or transitional epithelium: the stretchy innermost lining made up of urothelial or transitional cells.
  Lamina propria: a layer of connective tissue, blood vessels and nerves.
  Muscularis propria: a thick layer of muscles cells that push out urine during urination.
  Fat: the outermost layer of fat cells that separate the bladder from neighboring organs. |  | The most common type of bladder cancer is transitional cell (urothelial) carcinoma, which accounts for 90% of diagnosed cases. The affected cells resemble the urothelium cells of the inner bladder lining. Since urothelium cells also line other organs in the urinary tract, this type of cancer may also be found in the kidneys, ureters and urethra. | There are two subtypes of urothelial carcinomas, based on how the cells grow; papillary carcinomas form finger-like projections toward the inner hollow cavity of the bladder, while flat carcinomas do not form projections. Cancers are also classified as invasive or non-invasive based on the extent of growth through the bladder lining. Non-invasive tumors stay confined to the urothelium, while invasive tumors infiltrate the lamina propria and beyond - these cancers are more challenging to treat. | Other bladder cancers are squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma and sarcoma. These cancers are much less common and each make up ~1% or less of all bladder cancers. Bladder cancer is often diagnosed early with good outcomes for patients. However, due to its high recurrence rate, continued monitoring is necessary."	"The cell cycle has built-in checks and balances that prevent uncontrolled cell division. When these checkpoints fail - as a result of mutations in the genetic code of key genes - cells grow into tumors. The molecular details of how cancer begins are not fully understood, but the known risk factors include: | Age. Bladder cancer is more common in older individuals - 9 out of 10 people affected are over the age 55.
  Gender. Bladder cancer is 3-4 times more common in men.
  Race. Bladder cancer is more common in White individuals.
  Family history and genetics. The risk of bladder cancer is higher for those with a family or personal history of bladder cancer, including other cancers of the urinary tract. Although genetics are rarely associated with bladder cancer, some inherited diseases pose an increased risk. For example, Lynch syndrome, which is a hereditary disease linked to colon cancer, also increases the chance of developing bladder cancer.
  Chronic inflammation. Conditions that cause prolonged inflammation of the bladder (e.g. bladder/kidney stones and urinary tract infections) increase the risk of developing bladder cancer. The parasitic infection schistosomiasis, which is common in Africa and the Middle East, can also irritate the bladder and lead to cancer.
  Birth defects. Two types of birth defect increase a person’s likelihood for developing bladder cancer. The first occurs when the fetal connection between the bladder and the belly button fails to recede before birth. The second is when the inner lining of the bladder is exposed to the outside due to an abnormal opening in the abdominal wall.
  Cancer treatment. Past treatment with the cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) or radiation therapy in the pelvis region can cause DNA damage in bladder cells and cause them to become cancerous.
  Environmental toxins. Exposure to toxins and chemicals that are found in unregulated sources of drinking water or in certain manufacturing facilities have been linked to bladder cancer. These substances enter the bloodstream and eventually accumulate in the bladder, where they can affect cell integrity.
  Poor hydration. Drinking ample fluids throughout the day helps flush out the bladder. Infrequent urination allows potentially harmful substances to sit in the bladder where they can damage cells.
  Medication. Taking the diabetes drug pioglitazone (Actos) for more than one year is linked to bladder cancer.
  Smoking. The harmful chemicals found in cigarettes enter the bloodstream, get filtered through the kidneys and accumulate in the bladder where they can irritate the lining and cause cancer."	"The symptoms of bladder cancer include: | Blood in the urine
  Frequent urination
  Pain and difficulty while urinating. | Symptoms of advanced bladder cancer are: | Back or pelvic pain
  Loss of appetite
  Swollen feet."	"The following tests are used to diagnose bladder cancer: | Physical exam. The doctor may perform a digital exam of the rectum or vagina to feel for tumors on the bladder.
  Cystoscopy. This procedure allows doctors to visually inspect the bladder for tumors and remove samples for additional testing. It is carried out by inserting a thin tube (cystoscope) equipped with a lighted camera through the urethra and into the bladder.
  Biopsy. In order to confirm bladder cancer and determine the stage, a small tissue sample is removed (biopsy) for analysis. This is often performed during a cystoscopy. A needle biopsy is an alternate way of collecting cells by inserting a thin needle directly into the bladder.
  Urine analysis. A variety of urine tests are available to detect cancerous cells, protein markers for early-stage bladder cancer, or evidence of infection.
  Imaging. Various imaging tests are used to inspect the urinary tract and assess the level of cancer spread. An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is an X-ray of the urinary tract that visualizes tumors with the aid of a contrast dye. Other imaging tests include computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound. | Imaging tests are used to “stage” the cancer and determine the extent to which it has spread to other organs. Bladder cancer is staged from 1-4 (represented as Roman numerals I-IV). | Stage I: The cancer is present in the inner lining only.
  Stage II: The cancer has spread to the muscle layer.
  Stage III: The cancer has spread to the fatty layer and possibly neighboring organs.
  Stage IV: The cancer has spread to neighboring organs and possibly to the lymph nodes, lungs, or other distant organs. | Treatment options vary depending on the stage of the bladder cancer and the health of the patient. In most cases, bladder cancer is caught early and is fully treatable. Treatment options for bladder cancer include: | Surgery. Early-stage bladder cancer tumors are removed surgically using transurethral resection (TUR) or segmental cystectomy. TUR is performed during a cystoscopy procedure and uses laser energy or an electric current to burn cancer cells. In segmental cystectomy, the affected portion of the bladder is removed without affecting normal bladder function. For advanced bladder cancer, radical cystectomy is performed to remove the entire bladder as well as neighboring organs. Following this procedure, additional surgery is performed to reroute the path of urine.
  Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a systemic treatment that kills rapidly dividing cells (e.g. cancer cells) by interfering with DNA replication. It can be used to shrink tumors prior to surgery, or eliminate residual cancer cells following surgery. It is often the only viable treatment option for advanced bladder cancer.
  Intravesical therapy. This treatment places therapeutics directly inside the bladder. Immunotherapies like the synthetic immune protein interferon alfa-2b or the bacterium Bacille Calmette-Guerin act by triggering a local immune response. Intravesical chemotherapy helps shrink tumors without a toxic effect on the remainder of the body.
  Radiation. Radiation therapy is a targeted method of killing cells using high-energy radiation. It can be used for both early-stage and advanced bladder cancers, and is often used in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy."	Bladder cancer is caused by random molecular events that cannot be prevented. The best way to reduce the risk of developing bladder cancer is by eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding hazardous chemicals and not smoking. Those with a family or personal history of urinary tract cancers can discuss screening options with their physician.	"“Bladder Cancer”. American Cancer Society.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer	"Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast multiply out of control, forming an abnormal mass (tumor) that tends to invade surrounding tissues. Because cancer cells 
    
    
    
  grow destructively, they are also called malignant. |  | The most common breast cancer, ductal carcinoma, starts in the lactiferous ducts that transport breast milk to the nipple. Another type, lobular carcinoma, starts in the mammary gland lobules that produce milk. | Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is the term used for a small, early cancer that does not involve surrounding tissues. Invasive breast cancer is larger and spreads to lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The worst form, metastatic cancer, spreads to other parts of the body. | Breast cancer is diagnosed in 1 in 8 women in the United States with most cases occurring in women over age 50. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, following lung cancer. Rarely, this disease can occur in men."	"Female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, stimulate the growth of breast cancer. Many of the identified risk factors for breast cancer are related to a person’s exposure to 
    
    
    
  these hormones. |  | Female gender
  Older age
  Family history of breast cancer
  Personal history of breast cancer
  Early onset of menstruation (before age 12) or late menopause (after age 55)
  Chest radiation
  Women without children or first birth after age 30
  Ongoing use of oral contraceptives
  Hormone replacement therapy for menopause
  Sedentary lifestyle
  Alcohol
  Obesity after menopause | Some breast cancers are linked to inherited defects (mutations) in certain genes. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. DNA health testing can help you determine if you are at genetically higher risk of breast cancer due to BRCA1 and BRCA2. | A female’s age at menarche (first period), age at menopause, and reproductive history are important because women with a greater number of menstrual cycles over their lifetime have a higher exposure to estrogen."	"The typical symptoms of breast cancer include: | A breast lump
  Swelling or redness of the breast
  Dimpling of the skin
  Pitting of the skin (like an orange)
  Inversion of the nipple
  Redness, scaliness or thickened of the nipple
  Nipple discharge
  Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm or near the collarbone."	" | The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on the patient’s symptoms, physical exam, and test results. | Breast examination
  Mammogram (an x-ray of the breast)
  Ultrasound (the use of sound waves to produce an image of the breast)
  Breast biopsy (a sample of tissue is removed and examined for cancer cells)
  Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI | When breast cancer is diagnosed, the physician first determines the extent (stage) of the disease. The stage (based on the status of the lymph nodes, tumor size, and any spread to distant sites) determines the course of treatment and likelihood of survival. | Stage 0, the earliest breast cancer, is termed carcinoma in situ (CIS). This small, noninvasive cancer has not spread to any lymph nodes and is usually curable.
  Stage I is a small tumor without spread to the lymph nodes or a tiny amount of cancer is detected in nearby lymph nodes.
  Stage II is a larger tumor and/or involves a few nearby lymph nodes.
  Stage III is a very large tumor; or the cancer has spread to the skin over the breast or muscle beneath the breast; or the cancer involves many nearby lymph nodes. The survival rate is significantly reduced for stage III breast cancer.
  Stage IV is a tumor that has metastasized (spread to distant locations). Breast cancer commonly spreads to bone, liver, lung, or brain. Statistically with stage IV breast cancer there is only a 22 percent chance of survival beyond five years, underscoring the importance of early detection of breast cancer. |  | For staging purposes, a computed tomography is performed to provide detailed images of the breast. A bone scan is obtained to check for spread of cancer to the bones. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan also detects the spread of cancer. The status of the lymph nodes is determined when biopsies are performed during surgery. | Lumpectomy, for early-stage tumors, involves excising the tumor but not removing the entire breast.
  Mastectomy, for large tumors, removes all of the breast tissue.
  Sentinel node biopsy checks for cancer in the most dominant axillary lymph node. If cancer is not detected in the sentinel lymph node, it is unlikely to have spread to any other nodes.
  Axillary lymph node dissection is a more extensive removal of lymph nodes that is required when cancer is present in the sentinel lymph node.
  Double mastectomy (removal of both breasts) is a preventive option for patients at a high risk of developing cancer in the other breast.
  In some cases, breast reconstruction with artificial implants is performed. | Following lumpectomy, the chest is often treated with radiation to destroy remaining cancer cells and prevent a recurrence of cancer. Radiation is sometimes used after mastectomy as well. | Chemotherapy is prescribed when cancer involves the lymph nodes. These medications may be administered after surgery to destroy unseen cancer cells remaining in the body. Sometimes chemotherapy is given before surgery to shrink large tumors and facilitate their removal with surgery. | Most breast cancers are hormone receptor positive (carrying receptors for estrogen and progesterone). Certain drugs, selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) medications, block the action of estrogen and inhibit breast cancer growth. Other medications work by lowering estrogen levels in the body. | Some breast cancers produce large amounts of a protein called human growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Several medications are designed to target these types of cancers. | Exercise and activities like yoga or tai chi are often recommended to reduce stress."	There is a lower incidence of breast cancer in countries where the diet is low in fat; therefore, a low-fat diet and normal body weight may be preventative. Additionally, avoidance or limited use of alcohol lowers the risk for this disease. | Studies show that moderate to vigorous exercise significantly lowers the risk of breast cancer. There is still debate over how much exercise is needed. | Genetic testing for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is an option for women with multiple family members with breast or ovarian cancer. Women at very high risk may receive prophylactic medications or opt for prophylactic double mastectomy to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. | To detect cancer before there are any symptoms, screening consists of a triad of breast self-examination, clinical breast examination by a health care professional, and screening mammography. Physicians recommend that women 20 years and older perform monthly breast self-examinations. Women in their 20s and 30s should receive a clinical breast examination by a health care professional at least every three years. Over age 40, women should receive a clinical breast examination every year. For women age 40 and older, an annual screening mammogram is recommended.	"Davidson N. Chapter 204.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer	Colon cancer (also called colorectal cancer) is cancer of the large intestine, including the colon and rectum. All cancers begin when cells grow uncontrollably to form a clump of cells referred to as a tumor. Benign tumors are not life-threatening and can be removed when they cause discomfort. Cancerous (or malignant) tumors, however, can spread to other organs (metastasize) via the body’s circulatory system. Colorectal cancer is 90% curable if detected early. | The intestinal wall consists of five layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscle, subserosa, and serosa. Over 95% of all colon cancers are adenocarcinomas, which occur in the mucus-producing cells of the mucosa lining. Adenocarcinomas begin in the form of an abnormal growth called a polyp; however not all polyps are pre-cancerous. | Colorectal cancer affects both men and women as the third most common cancer. In the United States, colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths.	" | All cancers start with errors, or mutations, in the DNA of our cells. While some mutations are harmless, others can interrupt the processes that regulate cell division and maintenance, hence allowing uncontrolled cell growth. While the detailed mechanisms that lead to colon cancer onset are not fully understood, the following risk factors should be considered: | Genetic syndromes. Two inherited diseases that result from faulty gene function are associated with colon cancer. They are familial adenomatous polyps (FAP) and non-polyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome). FAP leads to hundreds of polyps in the colon, some of which become cancerous.
  Chronic inflammation. Diseases that cause chronic inflammation in the colon lead to a higher chance of colon cancer. These include ulcerative colitis, which is a break in the lining of the colon, and Crohn’s disease, which is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s are types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
  Lifestyle. A higher risk of developing colon cancer is associated with obesity; lack of physical activity; smoking; heavy alcohol use; and a diet low in fiber, fruits and vegetables, but high in fat.
  Age. Colon cancer is most common in individuals over the age 50.
  Race. In the Unites States, African Americans have the highest rates of colon cancer.
  Personal and family history. The chance of developing colon cancer is greater in women who have had ovarian, uterine or breast cancers. A family history of colon cancer increases a person’s chances of developing the disease, due to shared genetic and environmental factors. Individuals who have had colon cancer are at a greater risk for reoccurrence."	"As colon cancer advances, it can produce the following symptoms: | Bloody or narrow stools
  Diarrhea or constipation
  Sensation of rectal fullness
  Feeling full or bloated
  Gas pains and cramps
  Nausea and vomiting
  Unexplained weight loss."	"Early screening and diagnosis of colon cancer are carried out using the following methods: | Fecal test. As stool passes through the large intestine, rubbing against polyps can cause bleeding. A fecal occult blood test detects blood in the stool that is otherwise not visible. Since a variety of conditions can lead to a positive test, follow-up tests are required to identify the exact cause.
  Sigmoidoscopy. During this procedure, a flexible lighted tube with a camera is inserted into the rectum and lower colon to look for polyps. This instrument is also capable of removing tissue samples (biopsy) for further testing.
  Colonoscopy. A colonoscope functions similar to a sigmoidoscope, but is used to visualize the entire length of the colon.
  Imaging. Tumors can be detected using a type of computerized tomography (CT) scan that prepares both a 2- and 3-dimentional view of the colon. This technique is also called virtual colonography, and is the alternative to the more invasive colonoscopy. | Once a cancer is diagnosed, it is then “staged” to assess the extent of spread within the body. In order to stage cancer, various imaging techniques (CT scan or X-ray) and surgery are performed. Adenocarcinomas are typically staged from 1-4 (represented as Roman numerals I-IV). A stage 0 designations means the cancer has not spread beyond the mucus lining of the colon. | Stage I: The cancer has spread to the submucosa layer, but not the lymph nodes.
  Stage II: The cancer has spread to the outermost layer and possibly neighboring tissues, but not the lymph nodes.
  Stage III: The cancer has spread through all layers of the colon wall, to some lymph nodes, and/or possibly nearby organs.
  Stage IV: The cancer may or may not have invaded the colon wall, or spread to lymph nodes, but has metastasized to distant organs. | Treatment | Treatment options vary per patient and depend to a great extent on the disease stage; an early stage cancer has the best chances for a favorable outcome. Cancer is typically treated using a combination of approaches that are designed to kill and remove the affected cells. The 5-year survival rates for colon cancer ranges from 74% (stages I) to 6% (stage IV). | Surgery. Early-stage cancerous polyps can be removed completely - often during a diagnostic colonoscopy - and may not require further treatment. If cancer has spread through the colon wall, a colectomy is performed to remove the affected portion of the colon, as well as nearby tissues and lymph nodes. For advanced cancers, surgery is only performed to relieve the pain and discomfort associated with the growing tumor. Surgery is often combined with chemotherapy and radiation.
  Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs target and kill rapidly dividing cells, like cancer cells. Treatment also kills other rapidly dividing cells such as blood cells, and cells of the hair root and digestive tract, resulting in commonly known side effects like hair loss and nausea.
  Radiation. Radiation is a non-targeted therapy that kills all cells using high-energy radiation. Typically radiation is applied locally to the affected area of the body.
  Targeted drugs. Along with the above treatment paths, targeted drugs are available for treating advanced colon cancer. For instance, Avastin® (bevacizumab) is a humanized antibody that binds and inhibits a protein involved in blood vessel formation - a normal process that is also required for tumor growth.
  Experimental therapies. Advanced cancer patients may consider participating in clinical trial studies of therapies that are not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for public use. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available through health care providers."	Colon cancer screening in people over the age of 50, or those with known risk factors, is key to early detection. The risk of developing colon cancer can be reduced by refraining from smoking; maintaining a healthy weight; and eating a diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, but low in fat.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer	Liver cancer is a disease in which abnormal liver cells multiply uncontrollably and form a mass of cancer cells called a tumor. Cancerous tumors grow destructively and are described as malignant because they invade normal tissue and have a high mortality rate. Liver cancer is dangerous because the body depends on the liver to aid in digestion of food, eliminate toxins, and produce proteins for blood clotting functions. |  | There are two categories for liver cancer: primary and secondary. Primary liver cancer starts inside the liver. Secondary liver cancer starts in another area of the body and later spreads (metastasizes) to the liver. Most cases of liver cancer are, in fact, metastatic. For example, colon, lung, and breast cancer often spread to the liver. It is very important to distinguish metastatic liver cancer from primary cancer since these conditions are treated differently and therapies for metastatic cancer are based on the part of the body where the cancer originates. The information provided here pertains to primary liver cancer. | There are two types of primary liver cancer: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma. HCC is the most common primary liver cancer and begins inside liver cells (hepatocytes); whereas, cholangiocarcinoma is much less common and starts in the small tubes of the liver that carry bile (bile ducts).	"Several conditions increase the chance of developing primary liver cancer: | Viral hepatitis B or C
  Cirrhosis of the liver (an irreversible scar tissue formation that impairs liver function)
  Excessive alcohol
  Foods contaminated with aflatoxin (a poisonous cancer-causing substance produced by fungus found on improperly stored grains and nuts)
  Hemachromatosis (a medical disease causing accumulation of excess iron in the body)
  Obesity
  Diabetes
  Having a close family member with hepatitis and liver cancer | Asia and Africa have the highest rates of HCC because of their high incidence of hepatitis B and C. The occurrence of HCC in the United States has been increasing because of hepatitis C and obesity within the population. Learn more about how you can test for hepatitis C at home using a hepatitis C test kit."	"In the early stages of primary liver cancer, most patients have no symptoms. When symptoms develop, they may include: | Abdominal pain
  Nausea
  Vomiting
  Loss of appetite
  Weight loss
  Fatigue
  White colored stool | Since 80-90% of liver cancer patients also have cirrhosis, there may be excess fluid in the abdomen (ascites), yellowing of the skin (jaundice), confusion (hepatic encephalopathy), or bleeding."	Physical examination of the abdomen cannot detect small liver tumors, so imaging studies and blood tests are used to make the diagnosis. | Since there are no early symptoms and patients with cirrhosis have a high chance of developing liver cancer, doctors routinely use high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to screen these patients. An ultrasound provides a picture of the tumor in the liver. | A blood test is used to detect high levels of a substance produced by liver cancer cells called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). AFP is considered a tumor marker because it suggests that cancer is present. |  | Computed tomography (CT) is a type of X-ray that provides a detailed picture of tissues. A magnetic imaging (MRI) scan provides additional views of the liver and an angiogram evaluates blood vessels in the area. If bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is suspected, a procedure called cholangiography is used look at the bile ducts. | Some patients are also given a liver biopsy. This is a surgical procedure to remove a small sample of liver tissue for examination under a microscope. | After primary liver cancer is diagnosed, the next step is to determine how far the tumor has spread, which is called the staging of liver cancer. The stage determines the patient’s treatment options and likelihood of survival. Early-stage cancers that are small enough to be cut out with surgery have a better prognosis. Advanced cancers that are large or have spread outside of the liver are considered unresectable, meaning they cannot be cut out with surgery and typically have the worst outcomes. CT helps determine the stage by showing the extent to which the tumor mass has invaded the surrounding tissues. A bone scan is used to check for spread of cancer to the bones. | Surgery to cut out the tumor or replace the liver with one from a donor (liver transplant) offers the best chance for a cure. Organs for liver transplant are in short supply, and some patients are simply not healthy enough for surgery; therefore, many patients are given alternative treatments. Some treatments attempt to destroy cancer cells by freezing them with liquid nitrogen (cryoablation), or heating them with an electric current (radiofrequency ablation). In other treatments, the tumor is injected with substances that destroy cancer such as ethanol, anti-cancer medication (chemoembolization), or radioactive material (radioembolization). These alternative therapies may not completely remove the cancer cells and can predispose the patient to a recurrence of cancer. | Compared to other treatments, a liver transplant offers the best prognosis for long-term survival because all other treatments still leave patients with their underlying liver diseases, cirrhosis, and impaired liver function.	Since primary liver cancer is often caused by cirrhosis, any measures that prevent chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis also prevent liver cancer. Alcohol should not be abused and individuals may help prevent viral hepatitis by avoiding unprotected sex and intravenous drugs. Additionally, a vaccination against hepatitis B has been demonstrated to lower the incidence of liver cancer. Patients with cirrhosis are screened with liver ultrasounds every 6 months to detect cancer as early as possible.	"Di Bisceglie AM, Befeler AS. Chapter 94. Tumors and Cysts of the Liver.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer	" | Lung cancer develops when cells in the lung multiply abnormally, forming a mass (tumor) that grows destructively and invades normal tissues. Cancer can start in various parts of the lung such as the large air passages (bronchi), smaller airway branches (bronchioles), or tiny air sacs (alveoli). Lung cancer is especially lethal when it spreads (metastasizes) to distant locations in the body, such as the brain, bone, and liver. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death for men and women. | Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). The term small cell refers to the appearance of the cancer cells when viewed with a microscope. Nearly all patients with SCLC are heavy smokers. SCLC is a highly aggressive cancer that metastasizes very quickly and has a poor prognosis.
  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). The majority of lung cancers are classified as NSCLC. Patients with NSCLC are often managed differently than those with SCLC."	"Cigarette smoke contains cancer-causing agents that directly damage lung cells. Smoking is the primary cause of lung cancer; however, people who have never smoked can also develop the disease. | Risk factors for lung cancer include: | Smoking
  Secondhand smoke
  High indoor levels of radon (a radioactive gas emitted by soil)
  Asbestos (a material used for insulation and fire proofing)
  Air pollution
  Radiation therapy
  Arsenic
  Workplace chemicals
  Family history of lung cancer
  High-dose beta-carotene dietary supplements."	" | Patients with early lung cancer are usually asymptomatic. Symptoms of lung cancer typically start when the disease is already advanced. Symptoms include: | Persistent cough
  Cough with bloody sputum
  Weight loss
  Shortness of breath
  Wheezing
  Hoarseness
  Stridor (harsh noise while breathing in)
  Chest pain
  Weakness
  Nausea
  Loss of appetite
  Bone pain
  Abdominal pain
  Headache. | Sometimes lung cancers produce hormones that cause dysfunction in other organs in the body. These problems are called paraneoplastic syndromes."	"Asymptomatic, high-risk patients can be screened with a low-dose computed tomography scan (LDCT), an imaging test used to detect lung cancer at an early stage and reduce the chance of dying from the disease. | Most patients with lung cancer develop symptoms late in the course of the disease. When symptoms arise, several tests are performed to confirm the diagnosis. | Chest X-ray provides a basic image of the lungs.
  Computed tomography (CT) of chest provides more detailed images than a chest X-ray.
  Sputum cytology is a test that detects cancer cells in secretions from the respiratory tract.
  Biopsies are usually obtained during a bronchoscopy, a procedure in which a flexible instrument with a camera is passed through the mouth and trachea into the lungs, and samples of lung tissue are removed for examination under a microscope.
  When enlarged lymph nodes are present, a lymph node biopsy is performed to check for cancer.
  When the membrane (pleura) surrounding the lung accumulates excess fluid (pleural effusion), a procedure called thoracentesis is performed to drain and test the fluid for cancer. | When lung cancer is diagnosed, the next step is to determine the extent (stage) of the disease. Staging is based on the location of the tumor, number of lesions, involvement of lymph nodes, and presence of metastases. The lung cancer stage is determined by imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen; bone scan (to detect spread to the bones); and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT of the brain. | The stage is important because it determines the type of treatment required and prognosis. Small, early-stage tumors are more effectively treated than advanced cancers, which have spread to the lymph nodes or metastasized. | Treatment | Surgical resection is a procedure to cut out the portion of lung containing the tumor. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, the procedure may involve the removal of a section of lung (wedge resection), a lobe of lung (lobectomy), or the entire lung (pneumonectomy) on one side of the chest. Before surgery, a patient must undergo pulmonary function tests to determine whether the remaining lung will function adequately after the procedure.

    The lung cancer stage determines whether surgery will be an effective treatment. Surgery can cure early-stage NSCLC; however, surgery is not effective for advanced lung cancer that is deemed inoperable. Surgery is rarely used in patients with SCLC because SCLC is almost always metastatic by the time it is diagnosed. Such advanced cancers are treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation.
  
  Radiation therapy involves the administration of a high dose of radiation to destroy the cancer cells. Radiation may be used in combination with surgical resection, to eliminate any residual cancer, or in lieu of surgery for inoperable tumors.
  Chemotherapy utilizes medications that destroy cancer cells. Sometimes chemotherapy is used before surgery to shrink large tumors, or chemotherapy is administered after surgery to destroy residual cancer cells. Chemotherapy is used as the primary treatment for SCLC.
  Complimentary and alternative treatment: Beyond conventional medicine, a variety of therapies may be implemented to relieve problems such as pain, nausea, difficulty sleeping, and stress. Such treatments include acupuncture, yoga, massage, meditation, and hypnosis.
  Prognosis: Although some lung cancers are detected early enough to be cured, most cases are diagnosed and treated at a late stage. Despite a multitude of treatment options, lung cancer remains associated with a high mortality rate. | Surgical resection is a procedure to cut out the portion of lung containing the tumor.

Smoking is, by far, the main cause of lung cancer. Therefore, not smoking and avoidance of secondhand smoke will markedly reduce the risk of lung cancer. | Radon is another common cause of lung cancer. High indoor radon levels are commonly found in basements of homes and workplaces. Radon mitigation systems are available to reduce radon to a safe level. | A diet high in vegetables and fruit is strongly recommended to help prevent lung cancer, but high-dose vitamin supplements are not recommended. In fact, research shows that smokers who take high doses of beta-carotene supplements actually increase their risk of lung cancer.	"Gold KA, Glisson BS, Moran C. Chapter 14.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/lymphoma	"Lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system, which includes the following disease-fighting organs: | Lymph nodes
  Spleen
  Thymus gland
  Bone marrow. | Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the tonsils and digestive system. |  | Lymphoma starts when a white blood cell called a lymphocyte is damaged and begins to reproduce rapidly. These new “lymphoma” cells are flawed like the parent cell and don’t help the body fight infection. Eventually lymphoma cells crowd out healthy lymphocytes and form tumors in the organs of the lymphatic system. In the advanced stages of the disease, these tumors can metastasize (spread) beyond the lymphatic system. | Lymphoma usually (but not always) begins in the lymph nodes. There are about 600 lymph nodes scattered throughout the human body. Their function is to store white blood cells and to trap and destroy bacteria and other harmful substances. In addition, lymphoma can start in the lungs, stomach, intestines, brain, bones and skin. | There are two main types of lymphoma. Each has many subtypes. | Hodgkin lymphoma (also called Hodgkin’s lymphoma) is characterized by the presence of large, abnormal cells. It affects a type of lymphocyte called a B cell.
  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a collection of about 50 subtypes of lymphoma that grow at different rates and affect different kinds of lymphocytes. | Hodgkin lymphoma usually affects young adults and people over 55. About 10 to 15 percent of cases are in children and teens. In 2014, about 9,000 people will be diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, and 1,000 will die from the disease. | Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most common cancers in the United States, accounting for about four percent of all cancers. About 70,000 people are diagnosed with NHL every year, and about 20,000 die annually from the disease. The lifetime risk of developing NHL is about 1 in 50. Ninety-five percent of people with NHL are adults, and half of all patients are over 65."	"All cancers, including lymphoma, begin when a cell’s genetic information is damaged. | Every cell in the body has a genetic “blueprint” located in its nucleus. This information is encoded in a series of proteins called DNA. Every time the cell divides, its DNA replicates (copies itself). If something goes wrong during this process, it can cause permanent changes to the DNA. Substances in the environment can also damage DNA. In some (but not all) cases, cells with damaged DNA become cancer cells. | No one knows exactly what causes the genetic damage that leads to lymphoma. Some possible risk factors for the disease include: | Family history. Some types of Hodgkin lymphoma are more common in people whose relatives also have the disease.
  Radiation exposure. This usually occurs during a previous cancer treatment.
  Exposure to environmental toxins. Incidence of lymphoma appears to be higher in agricultural communities where certain pesticides are used.
  Immune-suppressing medications. These are most commonly prescribed to treat cancer or prevent rejection of a transplanted organ.
  Certain infections. People who have been infected with Epstein-Barr virus (mono), HIV, HTLV and H. pylori are more likely to develop lymphoma.
  Autoimmune diseases. Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis are examples.
  Lifestyle factors. A few studies have linked lymphoma to obesity and a high fat diet, though more research is needed to explore this. | Many people with lymphoma have no known risk factors."	"The most common symptom of lymphoma is an enlarged lymph node, which usually appears in the neck, groin, armpit or above the collarbone. Infections like colds or flu can also cause lymph nodes to puff up temporarily, but see a doctor if the swelling persists for two weeks or more. | Other possible lymphoma symptoms include: | Swollen belly
  Feeling of fullness, even when you haven’t eaten much
  Chest pain or pressure
  Coughing or shortness of breath
  Fever
  Weight loss
  Sweating at night
  Bruising
  Frequent infections
  Feeling very tired for no apparent reason
  Unusual sensitivity to alcohol, or pain in the lymph nodes after drinking alcohol."	"If you have symptoms of lymphoma, your doctor may refer you to an oncologist (cancer specialist) or hematologist (blood disorders specialist). | Diagnosis of lymphoma begins with a history and physical exam. The physician palpates (feels) the organs and lymph nodes for swellings and abnormalities. | If lymphoma is suspected, the doctor will order a biopsy (surgical removal) of lymph node tissue. This is sent to lab for microscopic examination and other diagnostic tests. | When a diagnosis of lymphoma is confirmed, the doctor will usually order additional tests to see how far the disease has spread: | Imaging tests (MRI, PET, CT scan)
  Bone marrow biopsy
  Lumbar or pleural puncture (a needle is used to draw fluid from around the spine or chest cavity). | Based on the results, the doctor will “stage” the lymphoma to describe how far it has spread. Stage I lymphoma is confined to a single organ or group of lymph nodes, while stage IV lymphoma has spread throughout the body to multiple organs. | Treatment | Lymphoma treatment varies by disease type, stage and the patient’s preferences and overall health. The first goal of treatment is to destroy all lymphoma cells and achieve full remission. If this isn’t possible, the disease can sometimes be maintained in “partial” remission, meaning cancer cells are present, but the disease isn’t progressing. | Many lymphoma treatments have side effects such as nausea and decreased immune function. During treatment, it’s important to work closely with your medical team to monitor your overall health. Your doctor may prescribe additional medication and treatment (called palliative treatment) to help lessen side effects. | Treatment for lymphoma may involve one or several of the following: | Watchful waiting. For some slow-growing lymphomas, treatment may not be necessary until the disease progresses.
  Chemotherapy. These cancer-fighting drugs are taken by mouth or intravenously. They’re usually given in cycles that alternate a few weeks of treatment with a few weeks of rest.
  Biological therapy. Biological treatments are man-made versions of antibodies, hormones and other infection-fighting and immune-boosting substances. These treatments can stimulate the immune system to target and destroy lymphoma cells. The course of this treatment is often similar to chemotherapy, with a few weeks of treatment followed by a few weeks of rest.
  Radiation. High-energy rays are used to target and kill cancer cells. In some cases, the radiation is delivered by a machine that aims radioactive beams into the tumor or target organ. In other cases, radioactive material is injected so that it can travel throughout the body.
  High-dose chemotherapy/radiation and stem cell transplant. The patient receives aggressive treatment that kills the cancer but also kills the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow. These blood-forming cells are then “transplanted” back into the patient in the form of stem cells (primitive cells that develop into new blood-forming cells). The transplant can come from the person’s own blood or bone marrow (which is harvested ahead of time) or from a compatible donor. | Prognosis for lymphoma depends on many factors. It is generally best for early-stage lymphoma that is contained to a single organ or group of lymph nodes. However, unlike other types of cancer, stage III and IV lymphoma may be quite curable depending on the subtype present. | About 60 percent of NHL cases involve aggressive forms of the disease that spread quickly if left untreated. (However, aggressive lymphomas are often easier to cure completely than slower-growing types, which tend to recur over time.) | In 2014: | The five-year survival rate for Hodgkin lymphoma was 85 percent and the 10-year survival rate was 80 percent.
  The five-year survival rate for NHL was 69 percent, and the 10-year survival rate was 58 percent."	Because no one is sure what causes it, there is really no practical way to prevent lymphoma. Maintaining good overall health, adhering to a nutritious diet, practicing safe sex (to prevent sexually transmitted infections) and seeking prompt treatment for health problems may decrease your risk.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/melanoma	Melanoma is a potentially lethal form of skin cancer that originates in melanocytes - cells in the epidermis that produce skin pigment (melanin). Cancer cells are called malignant because they multiply uncontrollably and form destructive growths (tumors). | Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and the most likely type to spread (metastasize) to distant organs. Small, early melanomas are highly curable, but advanced metastatic disease is often fatal. | In the United States, the incidence of melanoma is substantially increasing in both men and women. Melanoma usually occurs in adults and less commonly in children or adolescents; however, tanning and sunburns during childhood and adolescence markedly increase a person’s risk of developing melanoma later in life.	" | Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and tanning beds is the primary cause of melanoma. Individuals with fair skin have a higher risk for melanoma, but the disease can also arise in people with dark skin. | Melanoma can occur spontaneously or arise in an existing mole that changes in size and appearance. Melanoma may develop in any place in the body where melanocytes exist, including the eyes and digestive tract. | Risk Factors For Melanoma: | Sun exposure
  Severe, blistering sunburns in childhood or adolescence
  Light-colored skin, blond hair, red hair, or light-colored eyes
  The presence of large moles, numerous moles, or unusual moles
  Family history of melanoma
  Weakened immune system
  Exposure to radiation
  Exposure to industrial chemicals such as solvents or vinyl chloride."	"In women, melanoma most often occurs on the arms or legs; in men the condition often develops on the trunk, head, or neck. The most common signs of melanoma are unusual changes in the size, shape, or color of a mole, including darkening, discoloration, itching, enlargement, and bleeding. |  | ABCDE, a mnemonic for early signs of melanoma in a mole, stands for: | Asymmetry (one half of the mole is different from the other)
  Border irregularity (ragged or blurred edges)
  Color lacks uniformity (multiple colors are present, including black, black-blue, brown, and tan)
  Diameter greater than 6 millimeters
  Evolving or changing appearance. | Satellite moles, new moles that develop close to a pre-existing mole, often occur with melanoma. Bleeding and ulceration of an abnormal mole are late signs of the disease."	"Early melanoma is often extremely difficult to distinguish from benign pigmented moles. Suspicious lesions must be biopsied in a procedure that involves cutting out the abnormal tissue and a portion of surrounding normal tissue for examination under a microscope. | The extent (stage) of the disease determines a patient’s treatment, prognosis, and likelihood of recurrence. The stage is determined by: | Thickness of the tumor
  Whether the skin lesion is bleeding or ulcerated
  Whether there is lymph node involvement
  Whether the cancer has metastasized to distant sites. | Early stage melanoma is highly curable; however, more advanced stages are more difficult to treat. Metastatic melanoma, which most commonly spreads to the liver and lungs, has a high mortality rate. | For staging purposes, computed tomography (CT) provides a series of detailed images of various organs and tissues to detect metastases. Positron emission tomography scan (PET scan) may show evidence of tumor cells at distant sites in the body. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be obtained to provide additional images. | Treatment | Surgical excision is the primary treatment for thin, early-stage melanomas, which are highly curable.
  Surgical excision and a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node (the first node affected by the cancer) are performed for thicker melanomas.
  When cancer involves the sentinel lymph node, a more extensive removal of numerous lymph nodes is required.
  Chemotherapy, which uses medications to destroy cancer cells, is required for more advanced melanoma that has spread beyond the skin. Chemotherapy is often administered after surgery to destroy any remaining cancer cells and decrease the risk of recurrence.
  Radiation therapy may also be required to destroy remaining cancer cells.
  Immunotherapy involves drugs that stimulate the body’s immune system to defend itself against cancer.
  Targeted therapy uses treatments that attack specific types of cancer cells without damaging normal tissues."	Sun exposure is the primary preventable risk factor for melanoma. The skin should be protected by the avoidance of sun exposure between 10 am and 3 pm (the hours of highest ultraviolet radiation intensity). Sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or higher should be applied to exposed skin. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and protective clothing also provide essential skin protection. Children must be protected from sunburns to decrease their risk of developing melanoma in adulthood, and tanning beds should be avoided. | Early Detection | Self-examination of the skin can detect early signs of melanoma, such as new skin lesions or changes in the size, shape, and color of existing moles. A physician should evaluate any suspicious skin lesions. Individuals with risk factors for skin cancer should undergo an annual complete skin examination by a physician.	"Melanoma Treatment.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer	Prostate cancer is cancer of the cells of the prostate, which is a small walnut-shaped gland below the urinary tract and in front of the rectum. The prostate organ is part of the male reproductive system, and is responsible for producing some of the fluid that nourishes and helps transport sperm. Prostate cancer is not to be confused with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or “enlarged prostate”. BPH is an age-related growth of the prostate that is unrelated to cancer. |  | Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men in the United States, with an estimated one out of seven men becoming diagnosed. The great majority of prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas, meaning they began in gland cells. Prostate tumors grow slowly and may not be diagnosed until later in life (over the age of 65). In some cases, this cancer remains asymptomatic during a person’s entire lifetime. | Prostate cancer is treatable if detected early. However, aggressive or advanced forms of the cancer can spread to other organs (metastasize), or lead to erectile dysfunction and incontinence.	"During each round of cell division random errors, or mutations, can occur in the DNA of prostate cells. While some mutations are inconsequential, others allow cells to escape the mechanisms that control cell growth, leading to tumor formation. While the detailed mechanisms leading to cancer onset are not known, the following risk factors increase the likelihood of developing the disease: | Age. Prostate cancer is common in men over the age of 40, with the majority of cases being diagnosed after the age 65.
  Race and ethnicity. Prostate cancer is more common in African American men, and men of North American, Northwest European, Australian, and Caribbean Island nationalities.
  Family history. A family history of prostate cancer is associated with a greater risk of developing the disease due to shared environmental and genetic factors. Inherited mutations in the HPC1 (hereditary prostate cancer gene 1), and BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer early onset genes 1 & 2) are linked to some prostate cancers. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are also linked to breast and ovarian cancers in women, therefore a family history of these cancers increases the risk of prostate cancer in male progeny. Now you can test yourself to find out if you’re at higher risk of prostate cancer due to BRCA1 and BRCA2—learn more about DNA health testing.
  Obesity. Men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer and have a high body mass index are more likely to have the aggressive form of the cancer.
  Radiation. Prolonged exposure to radiation damages the DNA of cells and can increase the risk of all cancers, including prostate cancer."	"The close proximity of the prostate with respect to the bladder, urethra, and the nerves of erectile function helps explain many of the prostate cancer symptoms. The list includes: | Frequent urination
  Pain and difficulty while urinating
  Interrupted and/or weak urine stream
  Blood in the urine or semen
  Pain in the hips, thighs, or lower back
  Pain during an ejaculation
  Erectile dysfunction."	" | The following tests are used to screen and diagnose prostate cancer: | Physical exam. During a digital rectal exam (DRE) a doctor inserts a finger inside the rectum to feel for the prostate gland located directly in front. Additional tests follow if bumps or hardened areas are detected.
  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. This blood test measures the amount of a prostate-protein called PSA. Elevated levels of PSA are associated with various diseases of the prostate, including prostate cancer.
  Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). A TRUS uses reflected sound waves to construct an image of the prostate for better visualization of possible abnormalities.
  Biopsy. Depending on the results from other tests, a biopsy may be performed to collect a small sample of the prostate gland for further testing. This procedure is carried out by inserting a thin needle through the wall of the rectum to the adjacent prostate. | Following a positive diagnosis, various tests and imaging techniques are performed to “stage” the cancer and determine the extent of metastasis (or spread) beyond the prostate gland. Adenocarcinomas are typically staged from 1-4 (represented as Roman numerals I-IV). | Stage I: The cancer is present in a small area of the prostate gland.
  Stage II: The cancer has spread to a larger area of the prostate, or may still be small but considered aggressive.
  Stage III: The cancer has spread to the seminal vesicles and neighboring tissues.
  Stage IV: The cancer has spread to neighboring organs, to the lungs, or to other distant organs. | Treatment | Treatment options vary per case and depend on the patient’s age, overall health, symptoms, and cancer stage. Because prostate tumors grow slowly, some patients are monitored and never require actual treatment. The following treatments are available for prostate cancer: | Surgery. Early-stage prostate cancer can be removed - and often cured - using a surgical procedure called radical prostatectomy. A prostatectomy is performed by making an incision in the abdomen (retropubic surgery) or an incision between the anus and scrotum (perineal surgery). Less invasive laparoscopic methods (either manual or robot-assisted) that use a thin tube with a camera on the end (laparoscope) are also available.
  Radiation. Radiation treatment uses high energy to kill cancer cells. The treatment is directed at the prostate either externally using X-rays and protons (external beam radiation), or internally by implanting radioactive pellets that deliver radiation inside the prostate (brachytherapy). Radiation therapy is often used with other treatments to destroy remaining cancer cells or shrink the tumor.
  Hormone therapy. Prostate cells require the male hormone testosterone to flourish; thus hormone therapy removes testosterone to slow tumor growth. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonists block testosterone production in the testicles. Alternatively, removing the testicles by surgery (orchiectomy) may halt testosterone production faster than LH-RH agonists. Anti-androgens inhibit the function of testosterone by blocking their binding sites on proteins called receptors. Hormone therapy can be used to shrink tumors. It is also used when surgery and radiation therapies are ineffective or not an option.
  Cryoblation. As an alternative to radiation, cryoblation is used to kill cancer cells with cycles of freezing and thawing. In this procedure, cold and hot gas is delivered to prostate tissue using a thin needle inserted into the prostate.
  Chemotherapy. Advanced prostate cancer that has spread to distant organs can be treated with chemotherapy, which is a systemic treatment to kill rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. Chemotherapy is usually used when hormone therapy is not effective.
  Immunotherapy. Custom vaccines (Provenge®) that help the body’s immune system fight prostate cancer are available on a made-to-order basis. The vaccines are made by removing white blood cells from the patient and training them to recognize and destroy prostate cancer cells. The reprogrammed cells are then reintroduced into the same patient. This treatment is costly and used in rare cases for advanced prostate cancers.
  Experimental therapies. Advanced cancer patients who are not responding to available therapies may consult their doctors about available clinical trials for treatments not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."	Men can reduce their risk of prostate cancer by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Some medical organizations recommend routine prostate cancer screening for men over the age of 40. Those with a family history of prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers can discuss screening options for prostate cancer with their doctor.	"“What is Prostate Cancer”. American Cancer Society.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma	Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a cancer that forms in squamous cells. Squamous cells are thin cells found in the most superficial layer of the skin (epidermis) and other mucous membranes in the body. Cancer cells grow as a mass (tumor) that may also invade other tissues or spread to other parts of the body. | SCC is a major type of skin cancer. SCC usually develops on sun-exposed parts of the body, especially the head, neck, hands, and legs, but it may develop elsewhere. Other sites can include the lips, mouth, lung, digestive tract, bladder, anus, and genitals. | Early stages of SCC are highly curable with minor surgery. Rarely, SCC spreads (metastasizes) beyond the skin to other areas of the body. This form of advanced cancer requires much more extensive treatment.	 | Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the predominant cause of skin cancer. Cumulative sun exposure and the use of tanning beds are the major factors. Anyone can develop squamous cell carcinoma; however, certain Individuals have an increased risk. | Individuals with light-colored skin, freckled skin, blond hair, red hair, and light eyes have a greater risk for skin cancer. People with dark skin are more likely to develop skin cancer in parts of the body that are not exposed to the sun, such as the feet. | Areas of skin with scars, burns, or ulcers have a higher risk of developing SCC. Other risk factors include tobacco, tar exposure, cancer-causing chemicals (such as arsenic and insecticides), radiation exposure, and human papillomavirus (HPV) (learn how you can buy a reliable home HPV test kit online to check for HPV). Additionally, anyone with a weak immune system or an organ transplant has an increased risk of SCC.	"Squamous cell carcinoma commonly occurs in areas of skin with high sun exposure such as the face, scalp, head, neck, ears, hands, arms, and legs. | Common symptoms include the following: | Firm red growth or lump
  Scaly lesion that bleeds and become crusty
  Open sore or rough patch of the skin, lip, mouth, anus or genitals."	" | A biopsy is the main method for diagnosing SCC. A physician performs a biopsy by cutting out the growth for examination with a microscope. | When squamous cell carcinoma is diagnosed, the physician determines the extent (stage) of the disease by evaluating the depth of the cancer and whether it has spread. Treatment for SCC depends on the cancer’s stage. Early SCC is highly curable, whereas advanced SCC, which has spread to lymph nodes or metastasized to other sites, is more difficult to treat. | Stage 0 involves only the surface of the skin.
  Stage I is less than or equal to 2 cm in width.
  Stage II is greater than 2 cm in width.
  Stage III involves the underlying cartilage, muscle, or bone, or has spread to lymph nodes.
  Stage IV has metastasized to distant locations in the body. | Surgical excision involves cutting out the entire tumor and some surrounding normal tissue.
  Mohs surgery requires an excision of a thin layer of skin that is examined with a microscope. If cancers cells are present at the tissue edge, additional tissue is removed. These steps are repeated until the skin samples are free of cancer.
  Curettage and electrodesiccation involves scraping away the tumor and applying electricity to destroy residual cancer cells. This treatment is only for early tumors.
  Cryosurgery involves the use of liquid nitrogen to freeze and destroy cancer cells. This treatment is used in early cancers.
  Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a chemical and special light to destroy cancer cells.
  Laser treatment is used, rarely, for certain types of early cancers.
  Radiation therapy treats deep cancers that cannot be removed with surgery.
  Systemic chemotherapy is used for advanced cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body.
  Topical chemotherapy cream is only used in the very earliest stage of SCC."	Protecting skin from the sun is the most important way to prevent any type of skin cancer. Preventive measures include avoidance of direct sun exposure during the hours of 10 am to 3 pm (when UV radiation is highest) and use of sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30 or higher. Additionally, tanning bed use and smoking should be avoided. | Individuals should routinely perform a self-examination of the skin to check for new growths on the face, neck, ears, arms, legs, hands, feet, trunk, mouth, genitals, and buttocks. An examination by a health care professional is also important for detection of early signs of cancer.	"Skin Cancer: Basal and Squamous Cell.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/stomach-cancer	Stomach cancer (also referred to as gastric cancer) is cancer of the stomach. Cancer occurs when normal cells lose their ability to self-regulate and grow into an abnormal mass, or tumor. Unlike benign tumors, which are not life threatening, cancerous (or malignant) tumors can invade neighboring tissues, or spread to distant organs (metastasize) via the body’s circulatory system. Patient prognosis is highly dependent on the extent of cancer spread at the time of diagnosis. | The stomach wall consists of five layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscle, subserosa, and serosa. Stomach cancer usually originates in the mucus-producing cells of the innermost layer, where it is called adenocarcinoma - the most common of stomach cancers. Other types of stomach cancers originate in immune cells (lymphomas), endocrine cells (carcinoids), or rarely, cells of the nervous system (gastrointestinal stromal tumor). | Stomach cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the United States, roughly 22,220 new cases of stomach cancer are expected in 2014.	"The underlying cause of all cancers is an error (or mutation) in the cell’s DNA that alters the function of the affected gene. It is common for genomes of cancer cells to accumulate a number of mutations as they proliferate. Certain gene mutations impair the regulatory mechanisms that control cell number and survival, allowing uncontrolled cell proliferation. Although the exact mechanism behind disease onset is not clear, the following risk factors are associated with stomach cancer: | Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that infects and damages the mucus lining of the stomach, making it prone to peptic ulcers. H. pylori infection also increases the risk of stomach cancer.
  Inflammation. Long-term inflammation of the stomach, which occurs with pernicious anemia or following a gastrectomy, is associated with stomach cancer.
  Life habits. A higher risk of developing stomach cancer is associated with obesity; lack of physical activity; smoking; and a diet low in fruits and vegetables, but high in pickled, smoked, and salty foods.
  Age and gender. Stomach cancer is most common in individuals over the age 65, and affects men more than women.
  Family history. Genetic factors that make someone prone to a particular disease can be inherited. Therefore, a person’s chances of developing stomach cancer increases if close family or relatives have the disease. | "	"As stomach cancer grows it can produce the following symptoms: | Stomach pain and discomfort
  Persistent nausea and vomiting
  Feeling full or bloated after small meals
  Severe heartburn and indigestion
  Fluid accumulation in the stomach
  Sudden weight loss
  Difficulty swallowing."	"In patients experiencing symptoms, stomach cancer is diagnosed using techniques that visualize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and remove samples for testing. | Physical exam. A doctor or gastroenterologist performs a physical exam to feel for abnormalities in the stomach and lymph nodes. The family history of stomach cancer and other risk factors are also discussed.
  Upper endoscopy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG), also known as upper endoscopy, is performed to look for tumors. During an EDG a small, lighted camera is delivered down the GI tract using a long flexible tube. Usually a small tissue sample is removed (biopsy) to confirm cancer is present and to determine the type (e.g., adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or lymphoma).
  Imaging. Tumors can be detected using a computerized tomography (CT) scan or X-ray imaging. Prior to a CT scan, the patient receives an oral or intravenous contrast agent to aid visualization. The contrast agent for an X-ray is a thick chalky liquid containing barium (also known as “barium swallow”). | Following a positive diagnosis, the cancer is “staged” to determine the extent of spreading within the stomach, and to other organs. Staging requires a close examination of the stomach and other organs using imaging techniques and surgery. Specific laboratory tests are also performed to assess blood counts and key bodily functions. | Imaging. The stomach and other organs are inspected in detail using a CT scan or X-ray imaging. A chest X-ray inspects the lungs for tumors, while a CT scan can detect tumors in the liver, pancreas, and other organs.
  Endoscopic ultrasound. A probe that emits sound waves is delivered down the GI tract using a thin tube. The emitted sound waves bounce off the organs, and a computer translates the resulting echo pattern into an image. This technique is used to evaluate the stomach wall and nearby lymph nodes.
  Laparoscopy. This minimally invasive surgical procedure is used to examine the stomach wall, nearby lymph nodes, and remove samples when necessary. During a laparoscopy, instruments are delivered to the surgery site through thin tubes inserted into the abdomen. | The stages of adenocarcinoma range from 1-4 (represented as Roman numerals I-IV). Stage 0 indicates the cancer is confined to the inner mucus lining of the stomach. | Stage I: The cancer has spread mainly to the submucosa layer, and/or a few nearby lymph nodes.
  Stage II: The cancer has spread to the muscle layer, and/or more lymph nodes.
  Stage III: The cancer has spread through all layers of the stomach wall, many lymph nodes, and/or possibly nearby organs.
  Stage IV: The cancer has spread to nearby organs and/or many lymph nodes, and metastasized to distant organs. | The choice of treatment is highly dependent on tumor size and location, disease stage, and extent of metastasis. In general, cancer treatment involves killing and/or removing the cancerous cells. Early-stage cancer has the highest chance of a favorable prognosis. The 5-year survival rates for stomach cancer range from 71% (stages I) to 4% (stage IV). Many patients live longer than 5 years or are cured. | Surgery. Depending on the location of the tumor, surgery is performed to remove the stomach (gastrectomy), either partially or completely. In partial gastrectomy, the affected lower part of the stomach is removed, while in total gastrectomy the entire stomach and parts of nearby organs are removed.
  Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a systemic drug therapy aimed at killing cancer cells at the original site, and those that have spread to other sites. The drugs work by targeting rapidly dividing cells, like cancer cells. Common side effects of chemotherapy are due to inadvertent toxicity to blood cells, and cells of the hair root and digestive tract, all of which are also rapidly diving. Chemotherapy is often used in combination with surgery.
  Radiation. Radiation or radiotherapy targets and kills all cells, including cancers, with high-energy radiation. It is usually applied locally and in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy.
  Targeted drugs. In addition to the above therapies, cancer cells with specific characteristics can be targeted with drugs. For example, Herceptin® (trastuzumab) is a humanized antibody that targets cancer cells over-producing the growth-promoting protein HER2, and inhibits proliferation.
  Experimental therapies. Patients who cannot benefit from available treatment options may choose to participate in studies, or clinical trials, of treatments that are not yet approved for prescription to the public. Information about available clinical trials as well as the associated risks and benefits is available through medical providers."	The risks of developing stomach cancer may be reduced by not smoking; maintaining a heathy weight; and adhering to a diet that is high in fruits and vegetables, but low in salty, pickled, and smoked foods. Individuals with a family history of stomach cancer may consult their doctor regarding screening options for early detection.	"“Stomach Cancer”. National Cancer Institute. NIH. Oct 2009.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/aneurysm	An aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in the wall of a blood vessel. It usually occurs in an artery, a type of blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart and lungs to the body. | The most common location for aneurysms is the aorta, the body’s largest artery. The aorta carries blood from the heart downward to the abdomen, pelvis and lower body before branching into each leg. About 75 percent of aortic aneurysms occur in its lower section and are known as abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Aneurysms in the upper part of the aorta are called thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). |  | Aneurysms can also affect the arteries that carry oxygen-rich blood to the brain. In appearance, brain aneurysms resemble a berry on a stem. About one person in 50 has a brain aneurysm, and in most cases, the condition doesn’t cause any health problems. | Aneurysms can also form in the arteries of the legs, neck, kidneys and even within the wall of the heart itself. | Most aneurysms develop slowly over months or years, though they can appear suddenly when an artery is damaged by trauma. As an aneurysm grows, it becomes more likely to rupture or leak. A ruptured aortic aneurysm can cause severe internal bleeding and rapid death due to blood loss. A ruptured brain aneurysm can bleed into the brain, causing a stroke. Hemorrhagic strokes damage brain cells, increase the pressure within the skull, and are likely to cause death or significant disability. | Blood clots, which tend to form around the aneurysm site, are another potential complication. A clot that breaks away from the artery wall can travel through the body and lodge in smaller arteries, causing a stroke, heart attack or pulmonary embolism. | In addition, large aneurysms can press on nearby nerves, causing pain, tingling or swelling. | Aneurysms are a significant public health problem. Ruptured AAAs kill about 14,000 Americans annually. About 27,000 Americans experience a ruptured brain aneurysm each year, and the majority of these cases result in death or disability.	"The underlying cause of an aneurysm is a weak spot in the artery wall. Over time, repetitive pounding by the blood as it’s forced through the veins with each heartbeat causes the weak spot to bulge. The higher the person’s blood pressure, the more likely an aneurysm is to form. | Aneurysms impact men and women of all ages. Aortic aneurysms usually occur after age 65 and are more common in men. However, brain aneurysms are more common in women by a 3:2 ratio and usually occur between ages 30 and 60. | The following factors may contribute to the development of an aneurysm: | Genetic disorders - Inheritance plays a role in about 20 percent of aortic aneurysms. Hereditary conditions like Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken the walls of the arteries.
  Congenital malformation - Some people are born with defects to the aorta, heart valves or brain arteries that make them susceptible to aneurysms.
  Trauma - A blow to the head or chest can injure and weaken the arteries.
  Atherosclerosis - In this chronic condition, fatty “plaque” builds up on the insides of the arteries, causing them to harden, narrow and weaken.
  Infection - Syphilis, tuberculosis and other infections can attack and weaken the artery walls. (Learn how you can get tested for syphilis quickly and accurately using a syphilis home test.)
  Vasculitis - In this autoimmune condition, the body’s own immune system attacks the blood vessels, causing damage and inflammation.
  Lifestyle factors - Smoking, heavy drinking and cocaine use have all been linked to aneurysms.
  Menopause - In women, dropping estrogen levels can weaken the arteries and increase the risk of aneurysm."	"Many aneurysms, even very large ones, cause no outward symptoms. In fact, they’re often diagnosed by accident when a patient undergoes an imaging test for an unrelated condition. | When symptoms do occur, they differ based on location of the aneurysm as well as whether or not it has ruptured. | Pain in the abdomen, chest, back or scrotum, sometimes described as “gnawing,” “steady,” or “deep”
  Pulsating sensation in the abdomen. | Sudden, severe pain in the abdomen or low back that may spread to the groin, buttocks and legs
  Nausea and vomiting
  Signs of shock, including rapid heartbeat; cool, moist skin; light-headedness; confusion; anxiety; bluish lips and fingernails; and passing out. | Pain in the jaw, neck, back or chest
  Coughing
  Hoarse voice
  Difficulty swallowing
  Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing. | Sudden, severe pain in the back, abdomen, chest or arms
  Shock. | Loss of balance
  Speech problems
  Double or blurred vision
  Dilated pupil
  Numbness on one side of the face
  Pain around or behind the eyes
  Facial weakness or paralysis (may present as a drooping eyelid). | Sudden, severe headache
  Blurred or double vision
  Neck pain and stiffness
  Sensitivity to light
  Facial weakness or paralysis
  Seizure
  Shock. | A ruptured aneurysm is a life-threatening emergency. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience sudden severe pain in the head, torso or abdomen."	"When an aneurysm is suspected, patients may be referred to a surgeon for specialized diagnosis and treatment. The workup may include: | Physical exam - The physician checks blood pressure, feels the body for masses and listens to blood flow sounds.
  Imaging tests - These are used to determine the size, shape and location of the aneurysm and to aid in treatment planning. The most common test is computed tomography (CT), which uses X-rays to visualize body structures in two-dimensional “slices.” Other useful tests include ultrasound, echocardiography and MRI. A contrast agent (dye) may be injected into the blood to improve clarity of the images.
  Angiography - In this test, a flexible tube called a catheter is inserted through an artery in the groin and threaded to the site of the suspected aneurysm under X-ray guidance. Contrast agent is then injected through the catheter, and a special X-ray machine is used to visualize the blood and arteries.
  Lumbar puncture - A physician inserts a needle through the skin into the hollow space around the spinal cord and draws a sample of cerebrospinal fluid. Blood in this fluid could indicate a ruptured brain aneurysm. | Treatment | Treatment of aneurysm has several goals: | Prevent growth.
  Prevent rupture or leaking.
  Prevent or treat damage caused by the aneurysm to other body structures (for example, the nerves).
  Preserve quality of life. | Treatment decisions are based on the aneurysm’s size, the probability of complications and the person’s overall health. | For small aneurysms with a low risk of rupture, the doctor and patient may agree to simply monitor the condition for while. The patient receives regular CT scans to check for growth or changes in the aneurysm. The patient may also be advised to avoid certain activities that can raise blood pressure, such as drinking caffeine or straining to lift a load. | Medication therapy can also be beneficial for people with aneurysms. Drugs called beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers can help to reduce blood pressure and relax the blood vessels. This makes the aneurysm less likely to grow or rupture. | For ruptured aneurysms (or those at risk for rupture), surgical repair many be necessary: | Open surgery - An incision is made above the aneurysm site. The bulging portion of the blood vessel is removed and replaced by a section of tubing. In the case of a brain aneurysm, a clip is placed around the “stem” of the aneurysm to seal it off from the artery.
  Endovascular surgery - The surgeon makes an incision into the artery at the groin and inserts a catheter. The catheter is threaded under X-ray guidance through the arteries to the location of the aneurysm. A tube called a stent is then passed through the catheter and placed inside the aneurysm. The ends of the stent are sealed to the healthy blood vessel walls on either side of the aneurysm. This “bypass” prevents rupture and promotes healthy blood flow.
  Endovascular coiling - This is a specialized endovascular procedure that’s used to treat brain aneurysms. A catheter is inserted and guided through the aorta and into the brain arteries. A special coil in the catheter’s tip initiates a clotting reaction inside the “berry” part of the brain aneurysm. The clot fills the “berry” and seals off the opening through the “stem,” preventing rupture. | People who have experienced a brain hemorrhage may need additional surgery to relieve pressure inside the skull. This usually involves placement of a special catheter that drains excess fluid to an external collection bag or into the patient’s abdomen, where the body reabsorbs it. | The prognosis for aneurysm patients is generally good when the condition is diagnosed early, monitored and treated. However, ruptured aneurysms often have serious or fatal consequences. Only about 20 percent of patients survive rupture of an AAA. Ruptured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 40 percent of cases, and about two-thirds of survivors experience some form of permanent disability."	"Aneurysms are most treatable when diagnosed early. Regular screenings aren’t recommended for everyone but may be appropriate for some at-risk people. Ask your doctor about screening if you: | Are male, between ages 65 and 75, with a history of smoking
  Are between ages 65 to 75, and have at least two first-degree relatives who experienced an aneurysm
  Have a congenital abnormality or genetic condition that increases the risk of aneurysms. | Aneurysms aren’t always preventable, but you can take the following steps to promote the health of your blood vessels: | Quit smoking and drink in moderation, if at all.
  Avoid recreational drugs.
  Eat a healthy diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean meats and low-fat dairy.
  Reduce your intake of saturated fat, trans fat, sodium (salt) and sugar.
  Be physically active. Try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days.
  Get screened regularly for high blood pressure. If you know you have high blood pressure, work with your physician to manage the condition."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/atherosclerosis	Atherosclerosis is a hardening of the arteries that results from a buildup of plaque. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, clotting agents, cell debris, and other substances normally found in circulating blood. These substances accumulate at specific sites along the arteries and, over time, restrict or fully block blood flow to downstream organs, such as the heart, brain, and limbs. This process becomes accelerated when part of the plaque unexpectedly breaks off, or forms a blood clot. |  | Depending on the location of the plaque and the extent of blockage, other complications may result. Plaque buildup in the coronary arteries, which deliver blood to the heart, can lead to coronary heart disease - the primary cause of deaths in the Untied States. Reduced or halted blood flow to the heart may cause a heart attack. Plaque in the carotid arteries (carotid artery disease), which deliver blood to the brain, can cause a stroke. A blockage in the major arteries (peripheral artery disease) causes pain and numbness in the limbs and pelvis, while blockage in the renal arteries (chronic kidney disease) affects kidney function. An aneurysm is a bulge in the artery wall that can be lethal if it bursts. | Atherosclerosis can be managed (and prevented) with lifestyle changes and medical intervention. Every year approximately 380,000 Americans die from coronary heart disease.	"Atherosclerosis can begin during childhood and progress slowly into adulthood. It is not clear what triggers the plaque-forming substances to deposit on the arteries, but damaged or scarred sites are thought to play a role. The following can damage the artery walls or promote plaque formation: | High cholesterol. High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increase the chance of plaque formation. Unlike high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol transports fat into the arteries, and attracts macrophages that further grow the plaque.
  High fat. Elevated levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood increase the risk of atherosclerosis.
  High blood pressure. Chronic high blood pressure can damage the coronary arteries and lead to atherosclerosis.
  Smoking. Smoking promotes plaque formation by damaging the arteries.
  Inflammation. Inflammation due to injury or another underlying condition enhances the chance of developing atherosclerosis.
  Family history. The risk of atherosclerosis in higher for individuals with a family history of heart disease."	"Atherosclerosis may not produce symptoms until it is at an advanced stage, at which time medical attention is needed. Symptoms vary depending on the affected artery. | Coronary arteries. Atherosclerosis in arteries that carry blood to the heart may cause chest pain and pressure - also symptoms of a heart attack.
  Carotid arteries. Atherosclerosis in arteries that carry blood to the brain can lead to numbness in the limbs, droopy facial muscles, dizziness, and difficulty speaking.
  Peripheral arteries. Atherosclerosis in arteries that carry blood to the arms, legs, and pelvis can cause pain while walking, numbness and, in men, erectile dysfunction.
  Renal arteries. Atherosclerosis in arteries that carry blood to the kidneys can cause kidney failure."	" | The first step in diagnosing atherosclerosis is a physical exam. During the exam, a doctor listens for abnormal sounds in the arteries and looks for a decreased pulse in the limbs, both of which are evidence of restricted blood flow. Additional tests are performed to assess heart function and gain a closer view of the arteries. | Blood tests. Elevated levels of cholesterol, fat, sugar, and certain proteins are detectable in the blood and can be associated with atherosclerosis.
  Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram (EKG) measures electrical signals that pass through the heart, and can identify an irregular heartbeat or a past heart attack.
  Imaging. A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) allow closer visualization of the heart and arteries for evidence of plaques.
  Blood pressure tests. The ankle/brachial index test looks for blockage of the arteries in the limbs by comparing the blood pressure between the ankle and the arms; normally, blood pressure in the ankle measures the same or higher than in the arm. A Doppler ultrasound can also measure blood pressure at various points in the body.
  Stress test. This test monitors the heart’s performance while under stress, which is in the form of exercise (treadmill or stationary bicycle), or induced with medication. Abnormalities in the heart rate, rhythm, and overall function are easier to detect when the heart is pumping blood at a fast rate.
  Angiography. During an angiography, a dye is injected into the arteries through a thin catheter. X-ray imaging allows for visualization of the flow path of the dye, which mimics that of the blood, as well as any blockages along the way. | Treatment | A combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery may be used to treat atherosclerosis or slow its progression. | Lifestyle changes. Regular exercise; maintaining a healthy weight; and a diet high in fruits and vegetables, but low in cholesterol, fat, and salt help slow atherosclerosis. Avoiding smoking helps prevent plaque-promoting damage to the arteries.
  Medication. Prescription medications can help slow or stop disease progression. Drugs known as statins and fibrates are used to lower plaque-promoting LDL cholesterol, while boosting HDL cholesterol levels. Anti-platelet drugs reduce platelet aggregation and clotting in the arteries, which slows the growth of plaques and minimizes the risk of a complete blockage. Beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and water pills (diuretics) all help lower blood pressure, reducing burden on the heart.
  Surgery. When lifestyle remedies and medication fail to curb disease progression, surgery is used to physically eliminate plaque from the affected artery. During an angioplasty, a deflated balloon is delivered to the site of blockage where it is inflated to push back the plaque. Then, a mesh tube (stent) may be installed to act as a physical barrier against future plaque buildup. A carotid endarterectomy is performed to dissolve plaque from the arteries in the neck. Thrombolytic therapy helps prevent a heart attack or stroke by dissolving blood clots and restoring blood flow to the heart and brain, respectively. Coronary artery bypass grafting improves blood flow to the heart by using veins from other parts of the body to redirect blood past the blocked site."	The best way to prevent atherosclerosis is by staying physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, and making smart food choices - that is, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and avoiding foods high in cholesterol, fat and salt. It is also important to avoid smoking and stress-inducing activities. Individuals with a high risk of developing heart disease may consult their physician to determine the ideal preventative plan.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a fast, irregular heart rhythm in which the two upper chambers of the heart (the atria) quiver rapidly (fibrillate) instead of pumping at a normal steady pace. | The heart’s natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (SA node), is a collection of tiny cells that send electrical signals to produce heartbeats. Normally, the SA node generates electrical signals that trigger well-timed, organized contractions of the upper chambers (atria) and the lower chambers (ventricles). However, in AF, the electrical signals are fast and chaotic. The atria quiver rapidly and irregularly, so blood pools in the atria instead of being pumped properly to the ventricles. In some patients with AF, the ventricles also pump poorly in a condition known as heart failure.	"Underlying heart disease is by far the most common cause of AF. Numerous conditions leading to AF include the following: | Heart disease
  Heart failure
  High blood pressure (hypertension)
  Heart attack
  Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)
  Alcoholism
  Sleep apnea
  Lung disease
  Stimulants like caffeine
  Stress after an illness or surgery
  Hemochromatosis (iron overload) - you can screen for this, by the way; find out more about DNA health testing."	"During atrial fibrillation, some people do not experience any symptoms at all. Other individuals are affected by symptoms ranging from mild to severe. Symptoms include: | Feeling a fast heartbeat or fluttering in the chest (palpitations)
  Lightheadedness or dizziness
  Weakness
  Fatigue
  Shortness of breath
  Anxiety
  Chest pain. | Complications | Blood clot. In atrial fibrillation, blood pools in the heart and increases the risk of clot formation. A blood clot in the heart is extremely dangerous because it may break free, travel through blood vessels, and lodge itself the brain where it causes a stroke.
  Stroke. Individuals with atrial fibrillation have a significantly increased risk of a stroke from blood clot formation in the heart. Stroke occurs when blood flow to an area of the brain is markedly decreased. This lack of blood and oxygen results in brain damage that may permanently impair a person’s bodily functions.
  Heart failure. In atrial fibrillation, the ventricles may pump poorly and fail to deliver blood to the body. This debilitating condition, termed heart failure, leads to deteriorating symptoms."	"Usually a physical exam will reveal irregular heart sounds and an abnormal pulse rate. When atrial fibrillation is suspected, further testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. | Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a test that provides a recording of the heart’s electrical activity.
  Holter monitor. A Holter monitor is an external device worn continuously that records the heart’s electrical activity for 24 to 48 hours.
  Cardiac event recorder. While experiencing an episode of symptoms, a patient activates a portable cardiac event recorder, which monitors and records the electrical activity of the heart. The patient uses the device to transmit the data promptly over the phone to a doctor for analysis. | Treatment | Some people with AF spontaneously convert back to a normal rhythm without treatment. In other cases, some form of treatment is required. The specific treatment depends on how long an individual has been in AF and the severity of symptoms. | The primary goals of AF treatment include the following: | Antiarrhythmic medications are used to restore a normal heart rhythm completely. These drugs are not always effective, so alternative treatments may be necessary.
  Medications mainly used for the purpose of slowing the heart rate include beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. These medications do not cure the condition. The atrial fibrillation persists but at a much slower rate, so a person’s symptoms are under control.
  Blood-thinning medication is essential for permanent AF to reduce blood clot formation and the risk of stroke.
  When an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) is the cause of AF, anti-thyroid medications that treat the thyroid condition usually restore a normal heart rhythm. | Cardioversion. An electrical shock is delivered to the heart to reset the rhythm back to normal.
  Catheter ablation. Catheters are passed through blood vessels into the heart to heat or freeze (ablate) abnormal electrical pathways.
  Maze procedure. A Maze procedure is a type of surgery in which abnormal electrical pathways in the heart are destroyed."	AF is often a consequence of underlying heart problems; therefore, measures that prevent heart disease also reduce the risk of AF. Lifestyle factors like a healthy diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, and avoiding alcohol abuse are recommended.	"Atrial Fibrillation.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/chilblains	"Skiing, sledding and enjoying the outdoors are great ways to stay in shape during the colder months. But if you do venture out, it’s important to protect your skin from injury. Most people have heard of frostbite, but cold can also cause another painful condition called chilblains. |  | Chilblains are patches of skin in which the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) have been injured by chilling and rewarming. They’re typically red, swollen, itchy and painful. Chilblains most commonly affect the nose, fingers, toes, heels and ears. | Chilblains usually aren’t dangerous, but they can be very painful and unpleasant. The condition also makes the skin susceptible to infection, which can cause serious illness and permanent tissue damage. Because chilblains cause permanent damage to the capillaries, they tend to recur (come back) if your skin gets really cold again. | Experts aren’t sure how common chilblains are in the United States. In England, which has a cold damp climate, about ten percent of the population develop the condition each year. | Risk factors for chilblains include: | Being female
  Low body weight
  Family history
  Smoking
  Certain medical conditions, including lupus disease, diabetes, Celiac disease, and Raynaud’s disease."	Chilblains usually appear after skin is exposed to cold, damp air for several hours. They typically develop in temperatures between 32 and 60 degrees F. (Interestingly, they’re rare in extremely cold climates, which tend to be drier.) | No one is sure exactly how chilblains form, but experts believe they’re an abnormal reaction to rewarming. When the skin is cold, the capillaries get narrow. Sudden warming causes blood to rush toward these constricted vessels before they can open again. The excess blood leaks into surrounding tissue, causing pain and swelling.	"The first signs of chilblains are small patches of itchy, red skin that appear on the skin 12 to 24 hours after exposure to cold and rewarming.
These may be accompanied by: | Pain or burning
  Swelling
  Discolored skin (ranging from red to dark blue)
  Blistering or ulceration (in severe cases)."	"It’s usually fine to treat chilblains at home if symptoms aren’t too bad. Keep the affected body part warm, but not too hot. (Don’t place the area against a heat source like a stove and heating pad.) Avoid scratching the chilblain and use over-the-counter lotion to combat itching. If skin is broken, clean the affected area with antiseptic, keep it bandaged, and change the bandage every other day. | See your primary care provider if you notice the following infection symptoms: | Pus in the affected areas
  Feeling tired or generally unwell
  Fever above 100.4 degrees F
  Swollen glands. | Other reasons to seek medical attention: | Pain is severe
  Condition doesn’t improve in a week or two
  You have poor circulation due to diabetes or another medical condition. | Most cases of chilblains can be treated by a primary care provider. A history and physical exam are usually enough to diagnose the problem. | Chronic (long-term, recurring) chilblains can be a sign of another illness such as lupus disease or leukemia. To help diagnose any underlying medical conditions, your doctor may order: | Blood tests. Blood is drawn through a needle and analyzed in a lab.
  Punch biopsy. A small piece of skin is removed and viewed under a microscope. | To help heal chilblains and prevent recurrences, your doctor may prescribe: | Corticosteroid creams. These powerful anti-inflammatory medications can be rubbed on the injured area to reduce swelling and itching.
  Nifedipine. This blood pressure medicine relaxes the blood vessels and promotes healthy circulation. It helps to prevent seasonal recurrences of chilblains.
  Wound care. If the affected area is blistered or ulcerated, it should be cleaned regularly, treated with antiseptic and protected with a dressing to prevent infection. | If no infection is present, chilblains should clear up without treatment in one to three weeks."	"The best way to prevent chilblains is to avoid exposing your skin to the cold. Some tips: | Dress appropriately for cold weather. Layered clothing provides the best insulation.
  In very cold weather, cover all skin, especially your hands, feet, and face.
  Wear a hat to minimize heat loss.
  Restricted circulation can increase the risk of chilblains, so choose cold-weather clothing and footwear that fits well.
  Before going out into the cold, warm up your hands and feet.
  If skin does get chilled, rewarm it slowly.
  Stop smoking. This will improve your circulation, which tends to decrease the risk of chilblains."	"Chilblains (Dec. 6, 2012). Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. Retrieved Nov. 18, 2015, from http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chilblains/basics/definition/con-20033727.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis	Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, occurs when a blood clot (also called a thrombus) forms in a large vein of the body. Clots form when blood pools, thickens and clumps together. DVT is most common in the thigh, lower leg and pelvis, though it can also occur in the arm. | By itself, DVT is not usually life-threatening. However, clotting in a large vein blocks some or all blood flow through that vein, causing blood to build up behind the clot. This can damage the vein, resulting in a chronic (long-term) condition called post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). PTS symptoms include pain, swelling, discoloration and sores on the legs. | There is also a chance that the clot could break away from the wall of the vein and travel through the blood vessels. This can cause a life-threatening complication called pulmonary embolism (PE) in which a clot lodges in one of the main arteries of the lungs, preventing the flow of oxygenated blood to the body. | DVT isn’t always diagnosed, so experts aren’t sure how common it is. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 1-2 people per 1,000 develop DVT each year. In people over 80, this number may be as high as one in 100. | In addition, an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die from PE each year. Most (but not all) of these cases are caused by DVT.	" | Any factor that interferes with circulation or promotes clotting can increase a person’s risk for DVT, and many cases have multiple causes. | Inactivity is a major cause of DVT. Under normal circumstances, the contractions of the calf muscles as a person walks help circulate blood through the legs. But when a person is bedridden or sits for long periods during airline or car travel, the blood may pool in the legs, resulting in clots. | Some medical conditions and their treatments increase the risk of blood clots. Examples include: | Inherited clotting disorders (these affect about 5-8 percent of the population; learn how DNA health testing can tell you your risk for hereditary thrombophilia)
  Cancer and chemotherapy
  Inflammatory bowel disease
  Heart failure
  Pacemaker or central venous catheter
  Recent trauma or surgery, especially to the lower extremities. | Women with elevated estrogen levels are at increased risk for clots. Risk factors include the use of some oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. Risk is also elevated during pregnancy and for six weeks after giving birth. | Other risk factors for DVT include: | A personal or family history of the condition
  Smoking
  Obesity
  Being tall
  Being age 40 or over."	"It’s possible to have DVT without knowing it. In fact, doctors estimate that symptoms are present in only about half of all cases. These include: | Swelling in the ankle or foot (may be sudden)
  Leg pain, especially calf cramps (may only be noticeable when standing or walking)
  Patches of warm skin on the leg or foot
  Red skin
  Enlargement of the surface veins near the affected area. | DVT symptoms usually occur on just one side of the body. | PE symptoms include: | Sudden shortness of breath
  Chest pain that’s worsened by breathing deeply, moving or coughing
  Back pain
  Light-headedness, dizziness, fainting
  Rapid pulse
  Sweating
  Coughing (some people, but not all, cough up blood)
  Anxiety."	"Because of the potential for serious complications, it’s important to seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of DVT or PE. Call your doctor, or go to the nearest emergency room if your doctor is not available. | To diagnose DVT, a physician typically performs the following tests: | History and physical exam. Checks for outward signs of clotting as well as risk factors.
  Ultrasound. This test uses reflected sound waves to create images of body structures. When DVT is suspected, the technician may perform a duplex venous ultrasound, which involves applying pressure to the veins during imaging. Ultrasound is safe, noninvasive and very effective at diagnosing clots in certain areas (especially the thigh).
  Venography. Dye is injected into the leg veins, and an X-ray is taken of the blood vessels. This test is used when the suspected clot is in an area that is difficult to image with ultrasound, or when ultrasound is inconclusive.
  MRI or CT. Both of these imaging tests create 3D images of body structures. They are especially useful at detecting clots in hard-to-image areas like the abdomen, pelvis and lungs.
  Blood tests. Elevated levels of clot-dissolving substances in the blood can be signs of DVT or PE. | Treatment | Treatment of DVT has several goals: | Stop new clots from forming (and existing clots from growing).
  Prevent clot breakage and embolism.
  Prevent recurrences.
  Prevent long-term complications. | Depending on the severity of the condition and risk of complications, patients may be admitted to the hospital for treatment. | Anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) are usually the first line of treatment for DVT. These medications stop the blood from clotting, but won’t break up existing clots. Some anticoagulants are injected while others are taken by mouth. Anticoagulant therapy usually lasts 3-6 months.
  Thrombolytic medications are used to break up clots in the case of PE and other life-threatening situations. A catheter is threaded into the vein, and the drug is injected directly into the area around the clot.
  Vena cava filters are mesh screens that are placed into a large abdominal vein (the inferior vena cava) via a catheter to prevent clots from traveling into the lungs. They are usually used in people who can’t take anticoagulant medication for health reasons.
  Graduated compression stockings apply gentle pressure to the lower leg that prevents blood pooling and clotting. They also help reduce swelling while the clot dissolves.
  Angioplasty is a surgical procedure used to open damaged veins and restore healthy circulation in people with PST. A metal mesh tube called a stent may be placed in the vein to hold it open. | DVT is treatable, especially when detected early. However, PE can be quite serious, resulting in permanent lung damage and death. In fact, sudden death is the first symptom in about one-quarter of people who develop PE. | About 30-50 percent of people diagnosed with DVT will later develop post-thrombotic syndrome, and about one third will experience a recurrence of DVT within 10 years."	"DVT and PE are often preventable. The following steps can help reduce your risk: | Before and after surgery, take all preventative medications as prescribed.
  When traveling for four or more hours, find ways to contract your lower calf muscles. Walk around every 30 minutes, or do leg exercises in your seat. Avoid tight or restrictive clothing that may reduce circulation.
  After an injury or surgery, try to get up and moving as quickly as possible. Many hospitals now prescribe physical therapy on the day after surgery.
  Reduce your avoidable risk factors for DVT by quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight and controlling high blood pressure.
  If you are at-risk for DVT, ask your doctor about preventative measures like medications and compression stockings."	"“Deep Vein Thrombosis.” American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, 2009. http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00219. Accessed May 2, 2014.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/heart-attack	The coronary arteries deliver nutrient- and oxygen-rich blood to the pumping muscles of the heart. A block in the flow of blood to the heart can lead to tissue damage and death - otherwise referred to as a heart attack. Other common names for this condition are myocardial infarction and coronary syndrome. In the United States, there is an estimated one heart attack every 34 seconds. Heart attacks can be fatal and are a leading cause of death in adults. | A damaged or dead heart muscle is associated with various complications. Heart failure is a temporary or permanent condition where the heart can no longer pump ample blood to the body. Damaged heart muscles can also lead to irregular heartbeats (or arrhythmia) and heart valve damage, both of which can become fatal. The key to avoiding potentially permanent and deadly heart damage is to recognize the symptoms of a heart attack and seek immediate medical attention.	" | The main cause of a heart attack is a blockage in the arteries that carry blood to the heart. This process begins with the gradual buildup of plaque in the arteries (called atherosclerosis), which over time narrows the blood pathways and leads to coronary artery disease. When a rupture occurs at the site of plaque buildup, the body senses the damage and attempts to repair the site by releasing blood-clotting factors. A large clot that fully blocks the path of blood to the heart will result in a heart attack. | Heart attacks may also occur because of severe spasms of the coronary arteries, which are triggered by certain drugs, stress, and smoking. Coronary artery spasms are not common. The following risk factors increase the chances of having a heart attack: | High fat and cholesterol. High levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol promote plaque formation in the arteries. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol helps prevent coronary artery disease.
  High blood pressure. Chronic high blood pressure, which is associated with obesity, diabetes, and smoking, can damage the coronary arteries.
  Smoking. Tobacco use increases the chances of having a heart attack by promoting plaque formation and blood clotting in the arteries.
  Age and gender. The risk of having a heart attack increases with age - over the age 45 in men and 55 in women - with men bearing a greater risk.
  Family history. Individuals with a family history of heart attacks and heart disease are at greater risk for a heart attack.
  Chronic stress. Daily stress that is alleviated by smoking, alcohol consumption and overeating can lead to increased risk of heart disease and heart attacks. There is also evidence suggesting that chronic stress boosts the levels of white blood cells in circulation; white blood cells are a known component of plaque.
  Diabetes mellitus. Diabetes, a disease where the body does not produce sufficient insulin hormone in response to sugar, can increase the risk of having a heart attack.
  Inactive lifestyle. The lack of routine physical activity can lead to obesity and high cholesterol, both of which are risk factors for coronary artery disease.
  Obesity. High body weight is associated with high blood pressure and cholesterol, two risk factors for heart disease.
  Preeclampsia. This pregnancy-related condition elevates the blood pressure and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks."	"The classic heart attack symptoms are sudden chest pain and tightness, and shortness of breath. It is important to keep in mind that symptoms can vary. In particular, in women the symptoms can vary and can begin weeks before the actual heart attack. Women commonly report shortness of breath, nausea, fatigue, and body ache. | A more complete list of heart attack symptoms includes: | Pressure and tightness in the chest
  Shortness of breath
  Upper body pain (e.g. arm, shoulder, jaw)
  Cold sweats
  Fatigue
  Feeling lightheaded or dizzy
  Difficulty sleeping
  Nausea or discomfort in the abdomen
  Feelings like acid indigestion
  Nervousness."	"The initial tests to diagnose a heart attack are performed in the emergency room. Once a positive diagnosis is made, follow-up tests allow further evaluation of the heart. | Electrocardiogram. An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a noninvasive test that measures the electrical activity of the heart. Abnormalities in the resulting data reveal a past or ongoing heart attack.
  Blood tests. Elevated levels of specific cardiac enzymes known as troponins may be indicative of muscle damage from a heart attack.
  Imaging. The size, detailed anatomy, and condition of the heart are visualized using techniques such as chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An echocardiogram also produces an image of the heart by recording and processing sound waves that bounce back from the heart.
  Stress test. Following a heart attack, this test evaluates the heart rate and rhythm under stress either in the form of exercise (treadmill or stationary bicycle) or induced with medication.
  Angiography. This procedure uses X-ray imaging to visualize the flow of a contrast dye that is injected into the arteries, and detects blockages. | Treatment | The following lifestyle and medical interventions are used to treat a heart attack: | Lifestyle changes. Individuals who suffer a heart attack can improve their cardiovascular health and prevent future heart attacks by exercising regularly; maintaining a healthy weight; and sticking to a nutritious diet of foods that are rich in fruits and vegetables, but low in cholesterol, fat, and salt. Avoiding tobacco and limiting stress also helps maintain healthy arteries.
  Medication. Aspirin and drugs like it minimize damage to the heart by preventing clot formation. Similarly, thrombolytic drugs dissolve existing clots, while blood thinners make the blood less sticky, hence less likely to clot. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce burden on the heart by lowering blood pressure. Excessive chest pain is treated with pain relievers and nitroglycerine. Statin drugs that lower cholesterol can also enhance outcomes following a heart attack.
  Surgery. Surgical procedures that treat the cause of a heart attack include angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery. During an angioplasty, an existing plaque is compressed outward by inflating a balloon at the site. Then, a mesh tube (stent) is installed to prevent future plaque buildup at that site. Coronary artery bypass grafting restores blood flow to the heart by redirecting an existing upstream vein passed the blocked site."	Individuals with a high risk of having a heart attack may be advised to take aspirin and other blood-thinning medications. Blood pressure and cholesterol lowering drugs may also be prescribed to help prevent plaque formation. At-home measures for maintaining healthy cardiovascular health include regular exercise, a healthy body weight, and a diet low in cholesterol, fat and salt. At-risk individuals should also avoid smoking, limit alcohol, and eliminate high-stress activities.	"“About Heart Attacks”. American Heart Association. Jun 2014.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hemangioma	A hemangioma, also known as a vascular tumor, is an abnormal accumulation of blood vessels in the skin. They are one of the most common birthmarks associated with childhood and affect 10% of all children. About a third of diagnosed hemangiomas are present at birth (congenital hemangioma), while the remaining cases appear during the first three months of life (infantile hemangioma). | Hemangiomas close to the skin’s surface are called capillary hemangiomas, while those deeper beneath the skin’s surface are called cavernous hemangiomas. | Most hemangioma tumors are benign and not expected to spread beyond their original boundaries. The majority of hemangiomas are barely visible by age ten, without any medical intervention. Surgery or drug therapy is needed when complications such as bleeding or ulceration occur, or if the lesion interferes with vision or other vital functions. Larger and/or disfiguring hemangioma lesions on the face can be emotionally distressful for the child and his/her caregivers. Large hemangiomas may cause scarring or permanent change to the affected skin.	A hemangioma is an abnormal bundling and growth of blood vessels. Although the exact cause is not known, there is some evidence that the tumor initiates from a multi-potent stem cell. This evidence is being used to develop treatments that prevent the excessive growth of the tumor. | Hemangiomas are not linked to hereditary or dietary factors. However, they are more common in Caucasian female infants and premature babies.	 | Superficial (or capillary) hemangiomas develop close to the skin’s surface and often begin as a pink, flat area that becomes raised, with a bright red color. They mostly occur on the face and neck, and less frequently on the trunk and extremities. Deeper (or cavernous) hemangiomas form beneath the skin and appear skin-colored or bluish; these lesions can affect vision, breathing, or other bodily functions, depending on their location. Both superficial and deep hemangiomas may be present together. While most hemangioma lesions occur as a single growth, multiple lesions may be present in some cases. | Hemangiomas develop over three stages: | The proliferation, or fast-growing, stage occurs during the first three months of life in the majority of cases. A typical lesion grows to 0.5-5 cm in diameter, with some reaching up to 20 cm in diameter. Superficial hemangiomas grow to their signature bright red (or strawberry) color, while deep hemangiomas appear bluish and may protrude from beneath the skin. The lesion is the most prone to ulceration and bleeding during this period of rapid growth. | Most hemangiomas complete their growth over the course of 4-6 months and enter a quiescent (slow growing) stage, which lasts from 9 to 12 months of age. Then, the lesion begins to spontaneously lighten and shrink (involution).	"Hemangioma tumors are generally diagnosed visually. Additional tests may be performed to assess size and morphology. | Ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to construct an image of the tumor, allowing clinicians to inspect the degree of vascularization.
  Imaging tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are used to determine tumor size and proximity to other tissues.
  Biopsy. A tissue biopsy is performed if cancer or a legion other than a hemangioma is suspected."	"The majority of hemangiomas, especially superficial subtypes, shrink without intervention over the course of 5-10 years. In these cases, watchful monitoring is the routine course of action. However, an estimated 40% of hemangiomas require treatment because of complications that include visual obstruction, difficulty breathing and cardiac failure. The most common complication associated with hemangiomas is ulceration and bleeding, which is caused by drying, cracking or other physical injury to the lesion. Hemangiomas are most susceptible to injury during the proliferation stage. Ulcerated/bleeding lesions can be painful and require immediate medical attention in order to prevent excessive bleeding and infection. | The choice of treatment depends on the type, size and location of the hemangioma. | Medication. Steroid (direct injections, oral or topical) and beta-blocker drugs (propranolol) may be used early on to shrink large tumors, especially cavernous hemangiomas. Due to the risk of side effects associated with using steroids and beta-blockers in infants, their use is reserved for problematic lesions.
  Laser surgery. Laser light is used for shrinking hemangioma tumors or for cosmetic improvements to the affected area. For example, the appearance of discolored skin and minor scars can be minimized using laser therapy.
  Surgery. In some cases, surgery is used to excise the lesion in order to prevent irreversible damage to vision or permanent disfiguration of the affected area. | Currently there is no way to prevent hemangiomas. Bleeding and ulceration of hemangioma lesions can be avoided by keeping the area clean, moisturized and protected from rough or sharp objects."	"“Hemangioma”. MedlinePlus.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hemophilia	"The blood clotting process is critical for preventing excessive blood loss when the body is injured. Hemophilia is a genetic disorder where protein factors that help blood clot are missing, or not fully functional. As a result, those with hemophilia experience prolonged bleeding following injury, surgery or even minor trauma. Severe forms of the disease may cause spontaneous bleeding in the absence of any trauma to the body. Bleeding internally into the joints, brain or other organs can lead to serious complications when left untreated. | There are three main types of hemophilia (A, B and C) depending on which clotting factor is affected: | Hemophilia A: deficiency in clotting factor VIII
  Hemophilia B: deficiency in clotting factor IX
  Hemophilia C: deficiency in clotting factor XI. | DNA health testing allows us to check for genetic risk of Hemophilia C. | These clotting proteins act in concert as part of an extensive coagulation pathway that plugs the damaged site by activating platelets and fibrin proteins. Clotting efficiency is determined by the amount of functional clotting factors available. Hemophilia A and B are the most common disease types and have a higher incidence in males. Worldwide, roughly 1 out of 5,000 males have hemophilia A, while 1 out of 20,000 males have hemophilia B, at birth. The risk of developing hemophilia is the same across different ethnicities."	 | Hemophilia is an inherited disorder, which means the underlying genetic abnormalities are passed down from parents to their offspring. Hemophilia is the result of mutations (errors) in the genes that encode clotting factors VIII, IX and XI. These mutations lead to less effective versions of the clotting proteins, or their complete absence. When the critical concentration of clotting factors is not present in the body, clots form slower and bleeding is hard to control. | The mutations that are linked to hemophilia are on the X chromosome. Females receive two copies of the X chromosome (one from each parent), so gene products from one normal X chromosome often make up for any deficiencies present on the second X chromosome. Since inheriting two defective copies of the same gene is rare, the majority of females are carriers; they carry one hemophilia gene and can clot blood normally. | Males have a much higher chance of developing hemophilia because they only receive one copy of the X chromosome (from their mother). Instead of a second X chromosome, they inherit a Y chromosome (from their father), which does not duplicate the gene content of the X chromosome. Therefore, one defective X chromosome is sufficient for developing hemophilia. Hemophilia is called an X-linked trait because only mothers can pass it down to their sons. | A rare form of hemophilia known as acquired hemophilia is not due to inheritance, but instead happens when the body launches an immune attack against clotting factor VIII. This form of hemophilia begins in adulthood and leads to spontaneous internal bleeding into the joints, muscles and other tissue. Acquired hemophilia is not fully understood, but is linked to cancer, immune disease, allergies and pregnancy.	"All symptom of hemophilia are related to uncontrolled or unexpected bleeding, either externally (e.g. skin cut, nosebleed) or internally (e.g. knee, muscle, brain). The extent of bleeding depends on the amount of functional clotting factors present in the body; when the amount of clotting factor is low, bleeding symptoms become more severe. Internal bleeding into the joints, muscle and brain is serious and requires immediate medical attention. The following bleeding symptoms are associated with hemophilia: | Excessive bleeding following minor injuries (e.g. skin cut)
  Large skin bruises from bleeding within the skin
  Uncontrolled bleeding after receiving a shot or pulling a tooth
  Frequent nosebleeds that are hard to stop
  Blood in the urine or stool
  Pain and swelling in the joints due to internal bleeding
  Infantile bleeding after birth or circumcision
  Headaches and difficulties with vision."	"Hemophilia is diagnosed using blood tests that assess clotting efficiency and measure for specific clotting proteins. People with hemophilia or with a family history of hemophilia can inquire about testing for themselves or their children. Prenatal tests for hemophilia are available, but they pose some risk to the fetus. Hemophilia is usually diagnosed between the age of 9 months and 2 years. Sometimes the disorder remains undetected until excessive bleeding following a surgery or injury. | There is no cure for hemophilia so treatment is achieved by replacing the missing clotting factors that allow blood to clot. The clotting proteins are generated recombinantly in the laboratory, purified from human blood or provided as part of whole plasma, and administered by infusion. With proper care, most people with hemophilia can live normal lives. The treatment choices include: | Infusions: Injections with the hormone desmopressin (DDAVP) helps stimulate the body to produce more clotting factor. This therapy is used to stop bleeding in patients with mild hemophilia A. One-time or repeated infusions of human-derived clotting factors or whole donated blood are used to stop bleeding in hemophilia A and B patients with moderate to severe disease. In the United States, hemophilia C patients are treated with plasma infusions. Routine at-home DDAVP and clotting factor infusions may be required.
  Other medications: Topically applied fibrin sealants promote clotting and are helpful during dental procedures. Antifibrinolytic drugs help preserve a clot once it is formed.
  First aid: Applied pressure, bandage and ice are helpful ways to prevent excessive blood loss from minor topical injuries.
  At home: Hemophilia patients should avoid blood-thinning or other medications that slow the blood clotting process. Wearing protective equipment will help avoid injuries to the body."	Hemophilia is an inherited disorder that cannot be prevented. Those with a family history of the disease can ask their doctors about diagnostic testing for themselves and their children.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids	Hemorrhoids form when the bundle of veins in the anus and lower rectum become enlarged and fall out of place (prolapse). Hemorrhoidal tissue, which consists of blood vessels, connective tissue, and some muscle, is actually a normal part of human anatomy. More accurately, it is the enlargement of hemorrhoids that causes discomfort. | Hemorrhoids are classified into two types: internal and external. Internal hemorrhoids develop inside the lower rectum and anus beneath the mucosa lining and are generally painless. External hemorrhoids show up as lumps around the anus and may cause severe pain. Treatment varies depending on the symptoms and diagnosis, and usually does not require surgery. In the U.S. it is estimated that 4.4% of adults suffer from hemorrhoids - the majority being 45-65 years old.	"Activities that exert pressure on the vein clusters in the anus and lower rectum (also called anal cushions) are believed to cause enlarged hemorrhoids. Even the upright human posture is often blamed as a contributing factor. | Irregular bowel movement. Constipation, excessive straining during a hard bowel, and sitting on the toilet for extended periods are all associated with symptomatic hemorrhoids. These activities can disrupt blood flow to anal cushions, and lead to bulging and prolapse of internal hemorrhoids, or blood clotting in external hemorrhoids. Chronic diarrhea and overuse of laxatives and enemas may also exacerbate these symptoms.
  Pregnancy. Symptomatic hemorrhoids are common during pregnancy because the expanding uterus pushes against the anal cushions. This condition is temporary and usually resolves itself after birth.
  Age. As the body ages, the tissues supporting hemorrhoids can weaken, allowing prolapse."	"The most common symptoms of hemorrhoids are pain and bleeding during a bowel movement. Other symptoms vary depending on clinical classification. | Internal hemorrhoids are generally pain-free, even when some bleeding is observed. Prolapsed tissue that falls out of the anus can be felt by hand, and may be associated with pain and itching. Large internal hemorrhoids can produce the sensation of rectal fullness.
  External hemorrhoids are bluish lumps that can be seen or felt by hand. They are associated with more pain due to their highly sensitive overlying skin, and can bleed if broken. Blood clotting in external hemorrhoids causes severe pain, and once dissolved, leaves behind loose skin (skin tags)."	"Diagnosing hemorrhoids involves medical history and physical exams. The perineal area is visually inspected for external hemorrhoids, skin tags, inflammation, and prolapsed tissue. A digital exam, where two fingers are inserted into the rectum, may be performed to look for blood or other irregularities. A short tubular instrument called an anoscope is often inserted in the rectum to visualize hemorrhoidal tissue and assess the anal canal. If blood is observed in the stool, a colonoscopy may be performed in order to rule out colorectal cancer and other more serious conditions. | Pain and discomfort associated with mild hemorrhoidal disease can be treated with at-home remedies. More severe cases require band ligation or surgery. | At-home remedies. A high-fiber diet and routine exercise soften stools and promote regularity. These habits help avoid constipation and the need to strain during a bowel movement. A sitz bath, which is a warm water bath for the buttocks, and various topical over-the-counter creams can soothe enlarged hemorrhoids and lessen discomfort. Severe pain associated with blood clotting in external hemorrhoids may require minor surgery.
  Rubber band ligation. Band ligation can completely eliminate internal hemorrhoids and is very effective at preventing recurrence. During this out-patient procedure, a small elastic band is placed around the hemorrhoid to stop blood flow. Following several treatments over 6-8 weeks the swollen tissue shrinks and falls off. Coagulation treatments work similarly by using laser or heat, but are less effective.
  Hemorrhoidectomy. When hemorrhoid symptoms persist or worsen in spite of other treatments, surgery is needed. During a hemorrhoidectomy, the affected blood vessels are removed via an incision around the hemorrhoid. Although this operation is an out-patient procedure, it is performed under general anesthesia and requires a short recovery period. Both internal and external hemorrhoids can be removed by hemorrhoidectomy, with a very small chance of recurrence.
  Stapling. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is a more recent technique where prolapsed internal hemorrhoids are stapled back to their original position. This procedure is less painful than a traditional hemorrhoidectomy and allows quicker recovery, but is generally considered less effective."	Maintaining regularity and soft stools is the best ways to prevent symptomatic hemorrhoids. This can be achieved with a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and regular exercise. Avoiding prolonged sitting and strain during a bowel movement also prevents excess pressure on the anal cushions.	"“Hemorrhoids”. American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS). ASCRS.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hypertension	"Hypertension, also called high blood pressure, is a condition in which the force of the blood against artery walls is elevated. Approximately one out of three adults in the United States has hypertension. This condition is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and often causes heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure. | Systolic and diastolic are the terms used to describe the two values measured during a blood pressure reading. The systolic pressure is the force inside the arteries when the heart beats (pumps blood out to the arteries). The diastolic blood pressure is measured between beats, when the heart is at rest. Blood pressure readings are recorded with the systolic number written above the diastolic number, for example 110/70 mmHg. In medicine, the standard unit for measuring pressure is a millimeter of mercury (mmHg). | Normal: systolic is less than 120 and diastolic is less than 80
  At risk (pre-hypertension): systolic is 120-139 or diastolic is 80-89
  Hypertension Stage 1: systolic is 140-159 or diastolic is 90-99
  Hypertension Stage 2: systolic is greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic is greater than or equal to 100"	" | Frequently, the cause of hypertension is unknown; this form of hypertension is called essential hypertension or primary hypertension. When hypertension is caused by another medical condition - for example, kidney disease or thyroid disease - the term secondary hypertension is used. Additionally, some medications such as birth control pills, steroids, and over-the-counter cold medications elevate blood pressure. | Family history of hypertension
  African-American ethnicity
  Obesity
  Age
  Birth control pills
  Sedentary lifestyle
  Alcohol abuse
  High-fat diet
  High salt (sodium) diet
  Low potassium diet
  Smoking | Children and adolescents normally have lower blood pressures than adults, and the incidence of hypertension increases with age. Unfortunately, the incidence of pre-hypertension and hypertension is steadily increasing in children and teens because of the growing problem of childhood obesity."	"Typically, people with hypertension do not experience any symptoms; therefore, many patients are unaware that they have a problem until complications arise. The only way to know whether hypertension is present is to measure it with a blood pressure gauge. | Untreated hypertension often leads to serious complications. High blood pressure damages arterial walls and promotes plaque accumulation, resulting in narrowing (stenosis) and hardening of the arteries throughout the body. Narrowing of the arteries leads to inadequate blood flow and damages organs. | Hypertension leads to the following complications: | Coronary artery disease that causes inadequate blood flow and injury to the heart (heart attack)
  Weakening of the heart so that it fails to pump enough blood to the body (heart failure)
  Inadequate blood flow to the brain (stroke)
  Kidney failure
  Inadequate blood flow to the legs (peripheral vascular disease)"	"A person’s blood pressure normally varies throughout the day and is usually lower during sleep and higher during periods of stress or activity. Because of this variability, blood pressure readings at two separate office visits help determine whether a patient’s usual blood pressures are high. | Usually, the goal of treatment is to reduce blood pressure to below 140/90. Because of the increased risk of complications in adults with coronary artery disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease, the treatment goal in these groups is a blood pressure below 130/80. | Hypertension is initially treated with lifestyle changes. However, in most cases, physicians recommend a combination of lifestyle changes and antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure. | Dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) emphasize vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low-fat and low-sodium foods
  Exercise
  Healthy body weight
  Quitting smoking
  Stress management and relaxation techniques | Physicians may prescribe one or more medications based on a patient’s response to treatment, other medical problems, and tolerance of side effects. | Diuretics, also known as water pills, simulate the kidneys to remove water and salt.
  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the body’s production of angiotensin II (a hormone that constricts blood vessels and causes hypertension). A dry cough is the most common side effect.
  Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) prevent angiotensin II from acting on blood vessel receptors. ARBs have fewer side effects than ACE inhibitors.
  Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from acting on blood vessels. These drugs relax (vasodilate) the blood vessels.
  Beta-blockers decrease the heart rate and also act as vasodilators. Side effects include severe slowing of the heart rate and exacerbation of asthma.
  Vasodilators work by directly relaxing the walls of the blood vessels. | Generally, high blood pressure is a lifelong condition that requires ongoing treatment after the blood pressure is under control. Because hypertension is asymptomatic, many patients do not properly adhere to their treatment regimens, making the condition difficult to control."	"In many cases, hypertension is preventable with lifestyle factors, such as: | Maintaining a low-fat and low-sodium diet
  Adopting a good exercise regimen
  Maintenance of a normal body weight
  Smoking cessation
  Stress management. | In addition, early treatment of patients with prehypertension or hypertension reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications."	"Victor RG. Chapter 67. Arterial Hypertension.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/myocarditis	"Usually a viral infection like a cold or the flu is not cause for alarm (though we should always take the flu seriously). But in rare cases, these viruses can cause a potentially dangerous heart condition called myocarditis. | The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through a system of vessels to almost every cell in the body. This process, called circulation, supplies the cells with oxygen and carries off waste products. The heart is divided into four hollow chambers that contract to squeeze blood through the vessels. | Myocarditis is the inflammation (swelling) of the middle layer of the heart’s muscular wall, also known as the myocardium. The condition causes the heart to enlarge and thicken, weakening the chambers inside and reducing the heart’s ability to pump blood. | Mild myocarditis usually isn’t dangerous. However, more serious cases may lead to: | Clot formation. Blood pools in the weakened heart, forming solid masses. These clots can clog arteries in the heart or brain, causing a stroke or heart attack.
  Arrhythmia. A fast or irregular heartbeat.
  Heart failure. Due to poor circulation, the body’s cells don’t get enough oxygen and waste products build up.
  Sudden death due to cardiac arrest. Experts believe that 5 to 20 percent of sudden deaths among young adults are related to myocarditis. | In a few cases, myocarditis can cause permanent damage to the heart, requiring lifelong medical care. In fact, about 45 percent of heart transplants in the United States are performed on people with myocarditis and a related disorder called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. | Fortunately, myocarditis is pretty rare, with only a few thousands cases diagnosed each year in the United States. While exact numbers aren’t clear, it’s believed to occur during 1 to 5 percent of viral infections. Most of these cases are mild, have no heart-related symptoms, and are never diagnosed by a doctor. | Unlike other types of heart disease, myocarditis often strikes younger people with otherwise healthy hearts. Groups at increased risk include children (especially newborns), pregnant women and people with HIV infection."	"Myocarditis develops when a pathogen (germ) infects the myocardium. The germ travels to the heart through the blood vessels, enters the myocardium cells and reproduces there. The body then sends special immune cells to fight the disease. Sometimes this immune response is so strong that it damages the heart along with the germ. | Viruses (including some very common ones) are the most common cause of myocarditis: | Coxsackievirus B (flu-like symptoms)
  Adenovirus (common cold)
  Parvovirus B19 (fifth disease)
  Echoviruses (stomach flu)
  Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis)
  Rubella (German measles)
  HIV. | Less common causes include: | Bacterial infections (notably Lyme disease)
  Parasites
  Fungal infections
  Allergic reaction to drugs
  Environmental toxins (for example, a venomous spider bite)
  Autoimmune diseases that cause the immune system to attack healthy cells."	"People with mild myocarditis often don’t have any heart-specific symptoms. However, they usually notice signs of an underlying infection, including body aches, joint pain, fever, sore throat, upset stomach, and diarrhea. | Heart-specific symptoms usually appear one to two weeks after the start of the underlying illness. The first is often shortness of breath during physical activity. This typically worsens and may eventually occur at rest or interfere with sleep. | Other common symptoms: | Chest pain or pressure
  Lightheadedness
  Arrhythmia (fast or irregular heartbeat)
  Swelling due to fluid retention in the feet and lower legs
  Feeling tired
  Sudden loss of consciousness. | Myocarditis may look slightly different in babies and young children. Common pediatric symptoms include: | Rapid or labored breathing (can interfere with feeding in babies)
  Skin that looks bluish or grayish
  Cold, pale hands and feet
  Urinating less or less frequently
  Swelling of the face."	"Anyone experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain or arrhythmia should seek medical attention. People with very mild symptoms can sometimes wait for a doctor’s appointment, but those with more serious symptoms should go to the nearest emergency department. | Myocarditis is diagnosed based on: | History and physical exam. Be sure to tell your doctor if you have had flu-like symptoms in the past few weeks.
  EKG. An EKG is a test that measures the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity through the skin. Heart rhythms can also be monitored over time by a wearable device called a Holter monitor.
  Chest x-ray. This imaging test can detect enlargement of the heart, lungs and blood vessels.
  Echocardiogram. This imaging test uses high-pitched sound waves to show the heart and blood flow in motion. It’s especially useful for detecting blood clots.
  Blood tests. When the heart muscle is damaged, blood levels of certain cardiac enzymes increase. Blood tests can also detect underlying infections that cause myocarditis.
  Catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. This procedure is the only way to diagnose myocarditis with certainty, but it is only used in severe cases. The doctor makes an incision in a large vein of the leg or neck and threads a catheter (flexible tube) toward the heart. An instrument is threaded through the tube and used to remove a small sample of heart tissue, which is then tested for signs of infection and inflammation. | Treatment | The treatment of myocarditis depends on the underlying cause. Goals of care include: | Fighting the underlying infection
  Restoring healthy circulation and heart rhythm
  Relieving symptoms
  Minimizing long-term damage to the heart. | People with mild myocarditis can often recover at home. Patients with arrhythmia or heart failure may need to stay in the hospital or even intensive care. | Many medications can help to manage myocarditis. In severe cases, they’re often given intravenously. | Anticoagulants prevent blood clots that can lead to heart attack and stroke.
  Antimicrobials kill some types of bacteria and viruses that infect the heart.
  ARBs and ACE inhibitors help relax and open the blood vessels so blood flows more easily.
  Beta blockers normalize heart rhythm and combat some effects of heart failure.
  Diuretics help to remove waste products that accumulate in cells during to heart failure.
  Intravenous immunoglobulin - purified antibodies (proteins produced by the immune system) that reduce damage to the heart in some patients.
  Steroids reduce inflammation caused by autoimmune disease. | Severe myocarditis cases might require: | Medical devices. Ventricular assist devices and intra-aortic balloon pumps are inserted into the heart to strengthen its pumping action.
  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient is connected to a machine that draws the blood supply through a special membrane, removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. ECMO essentially acts as an external heart and lungs, allowing these organs to rest and heal.
  Heart transplant. This is sometimes the best option when there has been severe, irreversible damage to the heart. | People recovering from myocarditis should rest and avoid exertion while the heart muscle heals. Heart failure patients may also benefit from a low-salt diet and fluid restrictions. | Prognosis | With proper treatment, about two-thirds of people with myocarditis recover completely. The remaining third experience long-term problems with arrhythmia and heart failure that require ongoing medication and management. | About 10 to 15 percent of myocarditis patients later have a recurrence. This can lead to cardiomyopathy, or chronic swelling of the heart. The symptoms and treatment of cardiomyopathy are similar to those of myocarditis."	"The best thing you can do to prevent myocarditis is to avoid infections known to cause the condition: | Take normal precautions against germs, such as properly washing your hands and avoiding sick people.
  Practice safe sex.
  In tick-prone areas, wear protective clothing and insect repellant.
  Get all recommended vaccines."	"Discover Myocarditis Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment (2015). Myocarditis Foundation. Retrieved Oct. 27, 2015, from http://www.myocarditisfoundation.org/about-myocarditis/.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/stroke	A stroke occurs when blood flow is significantly decreased to a portion of the brain, causing brain damage. A stroke can also occur when an artery bleeds inside the brain, resulting in brain injury. Also known as cerebrovascular accidents, strokes are serious, life-threatening events that often permanently impair bodily functions.	"An ischemic stroke occurs when blood flow is blocked in an artery that supplies blood to a section of the brain. This blockage deprives the brain of oxygen and injures brain tissue. The most common cause of ischemic strokes is a blood clot that clogs a brain artery. | A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when an artery inside the brain ruptures and bleeds. The bleeding creates a pool of blood that presses on the brain and damages brain cells. | Hemorrhagic strokes are commonly caused by the following conditions: | High blood pressure
  A budging defect (aneurysm) in the wall of an artery, which suddenly breaks open and bleeds
  Abnormal tangle of blood vessels (arteriovenous malformation). | A transient ischemic attack occurs when the blood flow to an area of the brain is decreased for a short period of time. In a TIA, the brain is not permanently damaged. | Risk Factors for Stroke | Unhealthy diet (low in vegetables, fruits and whole grains; high in fat, salt, and processed sugars)
  Elevated cholesterol
  Smoking
  Hypertension
  Diabetes
  Heart disease
  Abnormal heart rhythms, especially atrial fibrillation
  Advanced age
  Brain aneurysm
  African American, Native American, or Alaskan Native ethnicity
  Sedentary lifestyle
  Stress
  Depression."	"Symptoms of a stroke vary depending on the area of the brain that is injured. The associated loss of bodily functions may be temporary or permanent. | Common stroke symptoms: | Sudden weakness or inability to move the arms or legs or face (paralysis), typically affecting one side of the body
  Numbness
  Difficulty speaking
  Confusion
  Visual difficulties
  Dizziness
  Loss of balance
  Abrupt onset of a severe headache
  Loss of consciousness."	"When stroke symptoms occur, patients should call 911 for immediate transportation to the hospital, because rapid treatment is essential to prevent permanent brain damage. | The diagnosis of stroke is based on the symptoms and physical examination. Further testing is required to determine the area of the brain affected. | Computed tomography is an x-ray that provides detailed images of brain tissues.
  Magnetic resonance imaging uses radio waves and a magnet to generate images of the brain.
  Carotid ultrasound uses sound waves to provide a visual image of the carotid arteries.
  Carotid angiogram is performed with an injection of dye that creates a more detailed image of the carotid arteries.
  Echocardiogram uses sound waves to evaluate heart structures and detect a clot in the heart. | Treatment of Ischemic Stroke | Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used to dissolve the clot causing the stroke. To be effective, it must be administered within four hours of the start of symptoms.
  Antiplatelet medication inhibits platelets, the blood cells involved in clot formation.
  Blood thinning medications (anticoagulants) prevent clot formation. | Clot-dissolving medication can be delivered to the brain through a catheter.
  The clot can be physically broken up and removed with a tiny instrument inserted into the affected artery.
  Angioplasty and stent involves inserting a small balloon into the carotid artery and dilating a narrowed area. A rigid device is left in place to keep the artery open.
  Carotid endarterectomy is surgery that removes plaque from a blocked carotid artery. | Treatment of Hemorrhagic Stroke | Aneurysm clipping blocks the flow of blood into an aneurysm and prevents re-bleeding.
  Coiling (endovascular embolization) is the placement of small coils inside of an aneurysm to block blood flow into an aneurysm.
  Arteriovenous malformations can sometimes be removed.
  Intracranial bypass is a technique to re-route blood flow and restore circulation to areas of poor blood flow.
  Stereotactic radiosurgery uses beams of radiation to treat blood vessel abnormalities in the brain."	A variety of special therapists help patients recover as much strength and function as possible. However many patients experience some degree of permanent disability after a stroke. | Most strokes are preventable through adherence to a healthy lifestyle. A healthy low-fat diet emphasizing fruit, vegetables, and whole grains reduces the risk of stroke. Patients should also maintain a normal weight, quit smoking, and exercise regularly.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/tachycardia	Tachycardia is an abnormally fast heart rate. In adults, the heart normally beats 60-100 times per minute. A heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute is termed tachycardia. | Tachycardia may occur in children as well as adults. In newborns and infants, tachycardia is defined as a heart rate greater than 150 beats per minute. | There are numerous causes of tachycardia and the condition is very common. Although some forms are harmless, others are potentially lethal. | The heart comprises four chambers: two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). The heart’s natural pacemaker, the sinoatrial node (SA node), is a tiny collection of cells located in the right atrium that produces each heartbeat. | The SA node generates the electrical signals that control the speed (heart rate) and pattern (rhythm) of the heartbeats. These impulses cause the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The SA node also sends electrical impulses to another collection of cells, the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node conducts the impulses down an electrical pathway to the ventricles, which contract and pump blood out of the heart to the lungs and the rest of the body. | Any type of abnormal heart rate or rhythm is termed an arrhythmia. Tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia where the electrical signals controlling the heart travel across the heart faster than normal, triggering the heart to beat too rapidly.	"Numerous conditions can cause tachycardia. The severity of these problems can range from benign to life threatening. Common causes include: | Underlying heart disease
  Anemia
  Blood loss
  Overactive thyroid
  Anxiety
  Fatigue
  Smoking
  Caffeine
  Fever
  Emotional distress
  Medication side effects
  Street drugs
  Alcohol abuse. | Sinus tachycardia. Often sinus tachycardia is a normal response to certain situations such as exercise, anxiety, distress, or fever. Certain disorders such as thyroid disease, anemia, and low blood pressure are also associated with sinus tachycardia.
  Atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is characterized by chaotic electrical signals, triggering the atria to quiver rapidly and irregularly. Atrial fibrillation is often associated with heart disease, an overactive thyroid, or alcoholism. Frequently, AF causes blood clot formation inside the heart, which increases a person’s risk for stroke.
  Atrial flutter. This arrhythmia is similar to atrial fibrillation, except the rhythm is less chaotic.
  Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). This arrhythmia starts with electrical signals above the ventricles that travel down an abnormal electrical pathway or extra pathway. An extra pathway is the hallmark of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome - the leading cause of SVT in children and adolescents.
  Ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT is triggered by an electrical abnormality within the ventricles. During VT, the ventricles may fill poorly and inadequately pump blood. Sometimes a person becomes pulseless during VT - a fatal event unless immediately corrected.
  Ventricular fibrillation (VF). VF is a rapid, chaotic rhythm, in which the ventricles fail to pump blood at all. VF is a fatal arrhythmia, unless immediately converted to a normal rhythm. VF is usually related to underlying heart disease. Rarely, a blunt blow to the chest wall of a healthy person precipitates VF."	"Certain non-life-threatening types of tachycardia evoke no apparent symptoms. However, more deleterious forms interfere with the heart’s pumping ability, resulting in a number of serious events. | Feeling the heart beating too fast (palpitations)
  Dizziness
  Shortness of breath
  Chest pain
  Fainting
  Loss of consciousness (syncope). | Unstable low blood pressure
  Heart failure
  Blood clots
  Stroke
  Sudden death (cardiac arrest)."	"When a patient’s symptoms and physical examination suggest an arrhythmia, a physician performs tests to diagnose the disorder and assess for the presence of underlying diseases. | Electrocardiogram (ECG). This test records the electrical activity of the heart. An ECG is very limited because arrhythmias often come and go. Unless an individual is experiencing an episode of tachycardia at the time of the exam, the ECG result is normal.
  Holter monitor. A wearable device continuously records the ECG for a period of 24 to 48 hours.
  Cardiac event recorder. A recording device, used for a month or more, is manually activated when a person experiences symptoms. A recording of each episode is transmitted by telephone to a physician for interpretation.
  Echocardiogram. A transducer emits ultrasound waves through the chest to create a visual image of the heart structures in motion.
  Stress test. The heart is monitored while a person walks or runs on a treadmill in an attempt to provoke an episode of the arrhythmia.
  Tilt table test. Medication is administered to induce tachycardia and the heart function is monitored for changes as the patient is tilted to an upright position.
  Electrophysiologic study. Electrodes are passed through blood vessels to the heart to record electrical signals. This analysis creates a detailed map of the electrical circuitry and pinpoints abnormalities. Additionally, this procedure may be used to induce arrhythmias, allowing the physician to test the effectiveness of medications for treatment. | Treatment | Treatment depends on the severity of the arrhythmia and the presence of underlying diseases. | Vagal maneuvers. Certain physical activities stimulate the vagus nerve, a nerve that naturally slows the heart rate. For example, the Valsalva maneuver - bearing down as if having a bowel movement - can slow some types of tachycardia.
  Medications. Anti-arrhythmic medications are administered to control abnormal heart rates and rhythms. Blood-thinning medication is necessary for patients with atrial fibrillation, a risk for blood clot formation and stroke.
  Catheter ablation. Catheters are inserted through blood vessels into the heart to heat or freeze tissue and destroy (ablate) abnormal electrical conduction pathways. Ablation is commonly used to treat Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter.
  Cardioversion. A properly timed electrical shock (in synchrony with the heart) is delivered to the chest to restore a normal heart rhythm. The most common indications for this procedure are atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and SVT.
  Emergency asynchronous defibrillation. Defibrillation is similar to cardioversion except the procedure more rapidly delivers higher energy shocks in an attempt to convert life-threatening arrhythmias - pulseless VT and VF.
  Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). An ICD device is permanently implanted inside the chest to continuously monitor the heart. If VT or VF is detected, the device immediately delivers an electrical shock to restore a normal heart rhythm. ICD is indicated in persons with severe underlying heart disease at high risk for life-threatening VT or VF.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/appendicitis	The appendix is a small, worm-shaped pouch extending from the beginning of the large intestine (cecum). A long time ago, this structure may have been useful in ancestral humans, but it probably no longer has a function, so it is classified as a vestigial organ. | Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix that occurs when it becomes infected and filled with pus. As the most common abdominal emergency, appendicitis often occurs in young people 10 to 30 years old, but it can occur at any age.	"The exact cause of appendicitis is unknown, but it may result from an obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by feces (a hardened mass of feces often called a fecaloma or fecalith), seeds, foreign bodies, parasites, or tumors. Infections could also trigger appendicitis, resulting in distention and swelling of the tissue. | When appendicitis goes untreated, serious complications may develop: | Gangrene: Tissue injury and cell death
  Perforated appendicitis: The appendix ruptures, and feces contaminate the abdominal cavity (peritoneum) causing a life-threatening infection termed peritonitis.
  Appendiceal abscess: A perforated appendix creates a pocket of pus inside the abdomen."	"The predominate symptom of appendicitis is abdominal pain originating at the navel (periumbilical pain) then shifting to the right lower abdomen. Walking and movement exacerbate the pain, or sometimes the pain is so severe the patient cannot sit still. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. | If the appendix perforates, the patient may briefly feel better, followed by rapid deterioration, intense abdominal pain, spasms of the abdominal wall muscles (rigidity), elevated heart rate, and high fever. | Young children, pregnant women, and the elderly often have atypical symptoms or symptoms that mimic other conditions; consequently, appendicitis is more difficult to diagnose in these groups. Their higher incidence of delayed diagnosis increases their risk of perforated appendicitis. | Infants. In the early stage of appendicitis, infants may primarily demonstrate lethargy, irritability, and loss of appetite. They may not develop vomiting, fever, and pain until late.
  Pregnant women. The location of the abdominal pain may be unusual or the symptoms may mimic conditions related to pregnancy.
  Elderly. Fever may be absent and the quality of the pain may be atypical in elderly people. Their symptoms are often misdiagnosed as something else like diverticulitis or bowel obstruction."	" | Appendicitis must be diagnosed as quickly as possible, because the longer the condition goes untreated, the more likely a perforation will occur. | The physical examination may reveal a point of maximum tenderness over the appendix in a spot termed McBurney’s point; however, the absence of this classic sign does not rule out appendicitis. | Blood tests characteristically show an elevated white blood cell count, but in older patients with appendicitis, the white count may be normal. | About half the cases of appendicitis are diagnosed without imaging studies, but when the symptoms are atypical, these tests help confirm the condition. | Ultrasound. In this test, high-frequency sound waves are used to create images of the abdomen. Ultrasound does not expose the patient to ionizing radiation; therefore, it’s preferable for children and pregnant women. The disadvantages are its variable image quality and tendency to be more difficult to interpret.
  Computed tomography (CT). CT is a more reliable diagnostic test than ultrasound because it provides more detailed images. It’s very useful in adults with atypical symptoms and helps confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating a distended appendix with a thickened wall. In elderly patients with abdominal pain, a prompt CT of the abdomen is advocated because of their higher risk of appendix perforation. CT is rarely used in children and pregnant patients because of the exposure to ionizing radiation and increased risk of radiation-induced cancer in children.
  Diagnostic Laparoscopy. A long narrow instrument with a video camera (laparoscope) is inserted into the abdomen to inspect the tissues. This procedure is sometimes performed in women of child-bearing age who may have gynecological conditions that mimic appendicitis. | Surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy) is the primary treatment for appendicitis. Since the appendix does not have a known purpose, it can be removed without impairing bodily functions. Along with surgery, intravenous fluids and antibiotics are administered to treat infection. | There are two standard surgical techniques for appendectomy: laparoscopic appendectomy or open appendectomy. The most common technique, laparoscopic surgery, uses a video camera to remove the appendix through small slit-like incisions allowing for a faster recovery. When the laparoscopic approach is unsuccessful, the surgeon performs an open technique, which requires a larger incision in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. |  | Perforation tends to occur when there is a delay in diagnosis and the duration of illness is longer than 24 hours. The patient appears severely ill due to peritonitis from the spread of pus and feces in the abdomen. There is a greater risk for an abdominal abscess and wound infection, so patients require additional intravenous fluid and antibiotics. The surgery for perforated appendicitis is complicated since patients require extensive irrigation (cleaning of the abdomen with fluid) and monitoring for worsening infection. | This term refers to perforated appendicitis resulting in a walled off pocket of pus (abscess) characterized by fever and an abdominal mass. These patients are mainly treated with antibiotics rather than surgery. Sometimes a tube is inserted through the skin for abscess drainage. Several weeks later, after the infection is controlled with antibiotics, an appendectomy may be performed. | Despite having clinical features consistent with appendicitis, some patients have a normal appearing appendix at surgery. The standard practice is to proceed with removal of the appendix to avoid confusion if the patient experiences future episodes of abdominal pain. The surgeon will also thoroughly explore the abdomen searching for the actual cause of the patient’s symptoms."	There is no clear explanation for appendicitis and doctors are not recommending preventive measures at this time. An increase in dietary fiber has been proposed, but researchers have not proven that changes in dietary fiber prevent appendicitis.	"Townsend CM, Beauchamp RD, Evers BM, Mattox KL. Ch 51.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis	Cirrhosis is a condition in which a chronically diseased liver gradually develops hard scar tissue (fibrosis) and grows lumps (regenerative nodules) in an attempt to repair itself. Eventually, cirrhosis progresses throughout the liver resulting in irreversible liver damage and impaired liver function. The clinical features of liver failure develop because blood flow in the liver becomes obstructed and the liver loses its normal ability to support digestion, metabolize toxins, and produce proteins for normal clotting function.	Any progressive liver disease may lead to cirrhosis. Alcoholism is by far the most common cause of cirrhosis, followed by chronic hepatitis C, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B. (Learn more about hepatitis C test kit options.) | Less common etiologies include bile duct diseases (such as biliary atresia, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis), cystic fibrosis, autoimmune hepatitis, and inherited metabolic liver diseases (such as hemochromatosis, Wilson’s disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Also, drug toxicity and heart failure may cause cirrhosis. Thanks to advances in genetic science, DNA health testing can tell us more about our own risk of developing hemochromatosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.	"Cirrhosis progresses through two stages: | An initial stage with no symptoms, called compensated cirrhosis
  A late stage called decompensated cirrhosis, characterized by severe symptoms and complications | For many years, a patient may remain in the compensated stage without symptoms until finally decompensation occurs. | The symptoms of decompensation include anorexia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and itching. All symptoms and complications of cirrhosis are the result of two main consequences of the disease: portal hypertension and liver insufficiency. | Portal hypertension occurs as blood flow in the liver becomes obstructed and pressure increases in the portal vein. This condition leads to accumulation of fluid in the 
    
    
    
  abdominal cavity (ascites), pleural effusions, edema of the legs, dilation of superficial veins of the abdomen, and dilation of veins in the esophagus (varices). Upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding is a potentially life-threatening complication of esophageal varices. |  | Ascites may disrupt kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome), and ascitic fluid can become infected resulting in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. | An enlarging spleen (hypersplenism) sequesters platelets, thus lowering the platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and interfering with clotting function. Furthermore, a failing liver produces inadequate clotting factors and increases the risk for bleeding. | In late-stage cirrhosis, the liver becomes unable to excrete bilirubin (a normal waste product of red blood cells), which causes yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and eyes (sclera icterus) as bilirubin accumulates in the body. | A normal liver is capable of removing ammonia and other toxins from the body. However, as liver function declines, these toxins accumulate in the brain resulting in hepatic encephalopathy characterized by confusion, delirium, and ultimately coma. | Chronic liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, are also associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common kind of liver cancer, which carries a very high mortality rate."	The physical examination of a patient with cirrhosis may reveal abdominal swelling, muscle atrophy, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, and pinpoint bleeding in the skin (petechiae). The liver may feel lumpy (nodular) and an enlarged spleen may be present. Males can have testicular atrophy and excessive breast tissue (gynecomastia), while women may experience an absence of menstruation (amenorrhea). | Laboratory tests can be unremarkable or show an elevated bilirubin level, low levels of a protein called albumin, thrombocytopenia, and impaired clotting as evidenced by an elevated prothrombin time. Further testing with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects the presence of a cirrhotic liver; however, a liver biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard. | In cirrhosis, the areas of scar tissue are permanently damaged and cannot be reversed, so treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying liver disease and avoiding liver toxins to prevent further damage. Alcohol should be avoided, and if hepatitis is present, an antiviral medication may be prescribed. | Ascites is initially controlled with diuretic medications, which increase urination, such as spironolactone and furosemide. When diuretic medications fail, ascitic fluid can be directly withdrawn through a needle inserted in the peritoneal cavity (paracentesis). |  | Esophageal varices may require a procedure called endoscopic variceal ligation in which rubber rings are positioned to prevent variceal bleeding. Actively bleeding varices are treated with blood transfusion, an endoscopic procedure, and an intravenous medication (octreotide) to decrease the variceal blood flow. Patients with repeated episodes of variceal bleeding may require surgery or insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). | Hepatic encephalopathy is often managed with lactulose, a daily medication to reduce the body’s production of ammonia. Additionally, an antibiotic may be used to decrease the level of ammonia-producing bacteria in the intestines. | Liver transplantation, replacement of the diseased liver with a healthy organ from a donor, is an option when complications of the disease remain uncontrolled and the risk of mortality from the disease exceeds the risk of the surgery. Currently, the shortage of organs is the main limiting factor. | Given the irreversible nature of cirrhosis and difficult treatment, great emphasis is placed on preventing common liver diseases or halting the progression of any liver disease as early as possible.	Individuals can decrease their risk for acquiring a liver disease by limiting alcohol consumption and avoiding behaviors that increase the risk for hepatitis, such as unprotected sex and intravenous drug use. The most beneficial intervention is early treatment of any underlying liver disease before progression to cirrhosis.	"Garcia-Tsao G. Chapter 156. Cirrhosis and its Sequelae.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/encopresis	Encopresis is characterized by hardened stool and unintended soiling. It typically affects children over the age of 4 who have infrequent bowel movements. When children with chronic constipation or other types of stress resist the natural urge to pass stool, the stool accumulates in the rectum and large intestine and becomes hardened (impacted). This can eventually cause the colon to swell and lose its ability to sense or control bowels, allowing loose/liquid stool to leak out and soil clothes. | There are two types of encopresis; primary encopresis is associated with children who are not fully toilet trained, while secondary encopresis is associated with children who develop the condition after toilet training. Children suffering from encopresis may feel guilty or embarrassed and lose interest in socializing. Without proper treatment, encopresis can lead to chronic constipation, abdominal pain, poor appetite and bladder infections. The majority of patients develop healthy bowel habits with a combination of treatment and positive encouragement. Encopresis is six times more common in boys than girls.	"The main causes of encopresis are constipation and emotional stress. Accumulated stool in the colon can affect the nerves that control the bowel, leading to accidental soiling. | Constipation. Prolonged or chronic constipation is the common cause of encopresis. Irregular bowel movements enlarge and harden the stool, making it painful to pass. The anticipation of pain may cause a child to avoid the toilet, worsening the problem. A lack of exercise, poor hydration, a diet low in fiber and certain food allergies can cause constipation. Fighting the body’s natural signals to pass stool also leads to constipation. Children sometimes hold stool when they are in an unfamiliar environment, or simply forget to go because they are too engaged in activity.
  Emotional stress. Factors that create emotional anxiety or stress in children may interrupt their regular bowel routine and cause constipation. Events that lead to stress include parental dispute, birth of a sibling, challenges at school or moving to a new home. Children who are not toilet trained or are toilet trained too early may feel emotional and social distress. Other known childhood/adolescence emotional disorders that can trigger encopresis include oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder.
  Gender. For reasons that are not known, boys are six times more likely to develop encopresis."	"Most encopresis symptoms are associated with abnormal bowel habits. These include: | Constipation and hard stools
  Infrequent bowel movements
  Large stools that clog the toilet
  Unintentional soiling of clothes (loose/liquid stool)
  Hiding bowel movements and/or soiled clothes
  Avoiding friends or social situations
  Poor appetite
  Abdominal pain
  Frequent urinary tract infections."	"Diagnosing encopresis begins with a physical exam followed by tests that look for evidence of fecal compaction in the rectum and intestine. | Digital rectal exam. Doctors first check for the compacted stool by inserting a finger inside a child’s rectum. A lubricant is used to minimize pain and discomfort.
  X-ray. An X-ray of the abdominal area is used to visualize and assess the amount of compacted stool in the rectum and intestine. The X-ray may also be used in combination with a barium contrast fluid (barium enema) to enable better inspection of the intestine for physiological abnormalities, such as a physical blockage.
  Psychological evaluation. A thorough psychological evaluation will help identify underlying emotional stresses that may be playing a role. | The goal of treatment is to clear out the colon and help the child adopt a healthy bowel routine. Most treatment regimens include a shift in diet and establishing a bowel schedule. Treatment depends on the child’s age, toilet training status and other factors. | Colon emptying. Prior to teaching healthy bowel habits, a variety of methods are used to clear compacted fecal matter from the colon. Enemas that flush out fecal matter or laxatives (oral or rectal suppository) that trigger a bowel movement force out the stool. Other methods help by softening hard stools (stool softeners) or lubricating the stool/colon contact points (mineral oil).
  Diet. Once the colon is relieved from constipation, a change in diet helps maintain regularity. Proper hydration and eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains and other high-fiber foods will help to produce soft, regular bowel movements. Some children may benefit from avoiding fatty foods and dairy.
  Toilet routine. A toilet routine ensures regular attempts at having a bowel movement, with the goal of building healthy habits. This may include a predetermined schedule for using the toilet and various positive incentives to reinforce successes. Negative incentives (punishment for soiled clothes) are counterproductive and may impede progress.
  Psychotherapy. Psychotherapy helps address the underlying emotional causes of encopresis. It will also help children cope with depression, anger and other negative psychological consequences of encopresis."	The best way to prevent encopresis is through regular exercise (or outside play) and a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fiber. Fast foods and processed foods should be avoided. Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, helps keep stool soft. Recognizing and addressing emotional stress in children also reduces the risk of developing encopresis. This includes toilet training children at the right age (usually after 2 years old) and avoiding negative reinforcement tactics.	"At Home Chlamydia Test

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/gallstones	The presence of gallstones is a medical condition known as cholelithiasis. Gallstones are solid deposits that form inside the gallbladder, the small pouch-like vessel located posterior to the liver. | The liver produces a fluid called bile that is stored inside the gallbladder until it is needed to digest food. Bile flows from the gallbladder through a tube called the cystic duct, enters the common bile duct, and then empties into the small intestine to aid in fat digestion. | In some individuals, bile forms crystals that eventually grow larger in size and become gallstones. Most gallstones consist of cholesterol, which is a type of fat, while other gallstones, called pigment stones, are composed of bilirubin, calcium salts, and a variety of other substances.	"Cholesterol gallstones are more common in women than in men. Additional risk factors include: | Age over 40
  Rapid weight loss
  Diabetes
  Obesity
  Pregnancy
  Taking birth control pills
  Estrogen hormone replacement
  Family history of gallstones
  Native American or Mexican American ethnicity | Pigment gallstones are more likely to occur in patients with cirrhosis of the liver or hemolytic states, such as sickle cell disease."	"Over 70% of individuals with gallstones have no symptoms at all. In these cases, the gallstones are usually detected as an incidental finding on an unrelated test and typically do not require treatment. | Biliary colic occurs when gallstones intermittently obstruct the cystic duct, causing the following symptoms: | A steady, sharp pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
  Nausea
  Vomiting
  Heartburn
  Gas
  Fever | Attacks of biliary colic are often precipitated by ingestion of a large or fatty meal. | Acute cholecystitis occurs when a gallstone obstructs the cystic duct with such persistence that the gallbladder becomes distended and inflamed. If a patient has jaundice (a yellowing of the skin), the common bile duct is usually obstructed (choledocholithiasis)."	 | A physical examination typically shows right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness and occasionally an abnormal gallbladder is palpable by the examiner. Laboratory tests may show an elevated white blood cell count. Additionally, a mild elevation of serum bilirubin may occur. | A right upper quadrant ultrasound of the abdomen is a reliable test for detecting the presence of gallstones; however, when the ultrasound does not show gallstones, a hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan may be ordered to confirm a clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. A HIDA scan shows the movement of radioactive dye through the gallbladder and detects an obstructed cystic duct. | Symptomatic patients are treated with intravenous antibiotics and surgery to remove the gallbladder in a procedure known as cholecystectomy. The most common and least invasive approach is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in which cameras are inserted into the abdomen through small slit-like incisions, and the gallbladder is viewed on a monitor as it is removed. The advantage of this approach is a faster recovery and shorter hospitalization. If laparoscopic surgery is unsuccessful, an alternative approach called open cholecystectomy is used. An open procedure requires a larger incision and a longer hospital stay for recovery. | If gallstones block the common bile duct, the treatment includes an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a procedure to remove the blockage and reopen the duct. During an ERCP, an instrument is inserted through the patient’s mouth and passed through the small intestine where stones are visualized and extracted from the bile duct.	A healthy body weight and proper nutrition can decrease a person’s risk of gallstones. | Obesity has a negative impact by increasing the body’s level of cholesterol. Additionally, skipped meals, fasting, and rapid weight loss increase the liver’s production of cholesterol in bile. Diets that are high in calories, low in fiber, and high in refined carbohydrates also increase the incidence of gallstones.	"Doherty GM. Chapter 25. Biliary Tract. In: Doherty GM. eds.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/gastroenteritis	Gastroenteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestines. It is associated with diarrhea and/or vomiting and can be caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses. Viral gastroenteritis (often called stomach virus or stomach flu) is extremely common, affecting millions of people each year during the cold seasons. Most individuals recover at home without intervention. The complications resulting from gastroenteritis differ based on the pathogen and can include severe dehydration, kidney failure, and coma.	"Gastroenteritis is caused by a pathogen, usually a virus, and is transmitted when an individual ingests contaminated food or water. Outbreaks typically happen where a 
    
    
    
  larger number of individuals are in close quarters, such as in childcare centers and cruises. |  | Viruses. Viral gastroenteritis is the 2nd highest ailment in the United States. Despite being called “stomach flu,” it is not caused by the influenza virus. Rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, sapoviruses, and astroviruses are all associated with viral gastroenteritis and infect adults and children to varying degrees. Norovirus is the culprit behind most viral gastroenteritis epidemics; noroviruses are exceptionally virulent, requiring a median of only 18 viruses to infect. Virus is shed in the stool and vomit of an infected individual and can spread via direct (handshake) or indirect (food) contact.
  Bacteria. Several types of bacteria including E. coli and salmonella cause gastroenteritis. Food becomes contaminated when it is exposed to fecal matter on the farm, processing plant, or kitchen. Inadequate sanitation, improper food handling, poor refrigeration, and undercooked meats can all lead to bacterial food poisoning.
  Parasites. Giardiasis is a diarrheal disease cause by the Giardia parasite, the most common intestinal parasite in the United States. Parasitic organisms like Giardia live inside a host organism (animal or human) and are expelled through feces. Infection spreads when hard-shelled Giardia cysts are ingested; as few as 10 cysts may cause illness. Contact with a contaminated surface or untreated water allow the spread of giardiasis."	"Diarrhea and vomiting are the most common symptoms of gastroenteritis. Symptoms typically appear within a few days (viral and bacterial) or weeks (parasitic) of becoming infected and may include: | Nausea and vomiting
  Diarrhea
  Abdominal pain
  Fever and chills
  Dehydration (dizziness, thirst, and dark urine)
  Bloody stools (a symptom of bacterial gastroenteritis)
  Greasy stools (a symptom of giardiasis)"	"Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed based on symptoms alone. A stool sample may be used to identify the causative pathogen. Most patients with gastroenteritis treat their symptoms at home and fully recover within days to weeks. Hospitalization becomes necessary when complications such as dehydration, excessive weight loss, and high fever arise. | Hydration. Fluid loss due to repeated episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which is common in infants, young children, and the elderly. Regular hydration with simple broths and non-caffeinated liquids is required to replenish the body’s electrolytes. Oral rehydration solutions (e.g. Pedialyte®) are also available without a prescription. If sufficient hydration is not achievable at home, then a doctor administers fluids intravenously.
  At-home remedies. During bouts of vomiting and diarrhea, frequent intake of small amounts of liquid and simple foods (e.g. rice, potatoes and bread) is recommended. Avoiding foods high in fat and sugar, dairy, caffeine, and alcohol helps to relieve the symptoms of gastroenteritis. Over the counter drugs that slow or stop diarrhea are also available.
  Prescription medications. Antimicrobial drugs to treat bacterial and parasitic gastroenteritis are prescribed when symptoms become severe, or when complications develop."	The pathogens that cause gastroenteritis are very infectious and can survive outside the host for up to weeks. Extensive handwashing and avoiding contact with sick individuals are critical steps in preventing infection. Contaminated surfaces must be cleaned promptly with a dilute bleach or other disinfecting solution. Proper handling of food; adequate refrigeration; and thorough cooking of eggs, meats, and fish help prevent the growth and spread of harmful bacteria. Extra caution is necessary when traveling to countries where parasites like Giardia are common. Drinking water from untreated lakes and rivers is not advisable without first using an effective water purifier.	"“Viral Gastroenteritis”.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/gerd	As food passes from the mouth through the esophagus and into the stomach, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) prevents the backflow of gastric content. The LES, which is a bundle of muscles at the base of the esophagus, is not under voluntary control and opens only in response to swallowed food. This ensures the unidirectional movement of food and isolates the stomach’s acidic environment from the sensitive lining of the esophagus. | When a small amount of partially digested food and stomach acid escapes back into the esophagus, a burning sensation, or heartburn, results. Occasional heartburn, especially following a large meal, is normal in healthy individuals. However, frequent episodes of heartburn potentially indicate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which, if left untreated, can damage the esophagus and organs of the oral cavity, and lead to respiratory problems and esophageal cancer.	" | GERD results when the LES is weakened and not functioning properly, thus allowing the backflow, or reflux, of gastric juices into the esophagus. Body abnormalities and other factors including diet, obesity, and pregnancy can also contribute to GERD. | Diet and medications. Bloating of the stomach caused by overeating can exert outward pressure on the LES and cause acid reflux. Additionally, carbonated beverages, citrus fruits, tomato-based sauces, and fatty foods are among foods that may worsen the symptoms of GERD. Medications like calcium-channel blockers, anti-inflammatories, and narcotic pain relievers can also increase disease severity.
  Obesity. An increase in body weight has been linked to increased risk of GERD - especially in the white population. Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, changes in gastroesophageal anatomy and physiology affecting LES function offer one possible explanation.
  Pregnancy. 30-50% of pregnant women experience GERD symptoms, due to the maternal hormone progesterone. In addition to relaxing the uterine muscles, progesterone dampens muscle function in the LES.
  Hiatus hernia. This abnormal condition occurs when part of the stomach pushes through an opening in the diaphragm and into the lower chest cavity. GERD is common in individuals with hiatus (also called hiatal) hernia."	"Reoccurring heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD. The frequent exposure of other organs to stomach acids produces additional symptoms, including: | Stomach and chest pain
  Nausea and vomiting
  Chronic cough
  Sore throat, hoarseness, or laryngitis
  Wheezing
  Asthma and recurrent pneumonia
  Pain while swallowing
  Dental erosion"	"Gastroenterologists, doctors who specialize in digestive disorders, generally treat GERD symptoms prior to extensive diagnostic testing. For advanced or difficult-to-treat cases, various tests are performed to assess the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. | Upper GI series (barium swallow). This out-patient procedure uses X-ray imaging to examine the upper GI tract for ulcers, reflux, and physical abnormalities like a hiatus hernia. To aid visualization, the patient swallows a thick chalky liquid contrast agent containing barium.
  Upper endoscopy.  Endoscopy is a more invasive but accurate test for detecting GERD-related injuries and complications, such as ulcers, tumors, and inflammation. Once the throat is numbed, a small camera connected to a thin flexible tube is fed down the esophagus to look for injured tissue and collect samples if needed.
  Esophageal monitoring. pH monitoring and manometry assess the environment and function of the esophagus. pH monitoring (often paired with upper endoscopy) measures acid levels and the extent of reflux in the lower esophagus, while manometry measures the strength of muscle contractions, including that of the LES. | Treatments options for GERD vary based on symptoms and include lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery. | Lifestyle changes. Mild cases of GERD can often be treated with simple modifications in daily habits. Avoiding smoking and foods that trigger acid reflux; eating sensible portions; maintaining a healthy weight; wearing loose-fitting clothing; and elevating the head during sleep are all ways to manage symptoms.
  Medication. Both over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs are available to treat GERD symptoms. OTC antacids provide temporary relief by neutralizing stomach pH. Prescription proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor blockers actually reduce acid production in the stomach, and are the most effective treatment option. Prokinetic agents and antibiotics (both by prescription) act by promoting stomach emptying. Coating agents (by prescription) form a protective film over the esophagus and stomach.
  Surgery. Surgery is performed when GERD symptoms cannot be alleviated with medication, or lead to more serious health complications. The procedure commonly performed for GERD patients is a fundoplication, where the upper portion of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus and sewn in place. This increases pressure on the LES and controls acid reflux. Endoscopic procedures that tighten up the LES are also performed, but are less effective."	"Lifestyle changes that help treat GERD symptoms are also effective preventative measures. These include: | Not smoking
  Avoiding foods and drinks that trigger acid reflux
  Eating sensible portions
  Maintaining a healthy weight
  Wearing loose-fitting clothing
  Elevating the head during sleep"	"“Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) in Adults”. National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC). NIH. Sep 2013. Retrieved Mar 22, 2014. http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gerd/#cause.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/halitosis	Halitosis is an offensive odor also known as bad breath. This common problem affects approximately one-third of the population. | In 90% of individuals with halitosis, the underlying problem lies within the mouth and the condition is termed intraoral halitosis. Intraoral halitosis is primarily caused by oral bacteria, which produce foul smelling gases called volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). | The other 10% of cases are classified as extraoral halitosis because the underlying problem is outside of the mouth. Uncontrolled medical diseases or adverse effects of medications are the most common causes of extraoral halitosis.	" | Intraoral halitosis is frequently caused by the following conditions: | Gingivitis (gum inflammation) and periodontitis (gum disease). Gingivitis and periodontitis are caused by accumulations of bacteria on the teeth (dental plaque) and within pockets between the teeth and gums. These bacteria produce exceedingly high levels of foul smelling VSCs. Poor dental hygiene and smoking are known to increase the risk for gum disease.
  Tongue coating. Accumulation of food and bacteria on the dorsal surface of the tongue produces significant odors.
  Dental cavities. Tooth decay and associated infections commonly contribute to halitosis.
  Food. When teeth are improperly brushed and flossed, bacteria adhere to food particles retained between the teeth and produce offensive odors. Additionally, some foods like garlic and onions temporarily cause bad breath.
  Dry mouth (xerostomia). An inadequate amount of saliva makes clearing food particles more difficult. | Extraoral halitosis is commonly caused by the following disorders: | Liver failure
  Diabetes mellitus
  Kidney failure
  Tonsil infections (tonsillitis)
  Nasal cavity and sinus infections (sinusitis)
  Nasal obstruction, resulting in mouth breathing and dry mouth
  Certain cancers
  Lung diseases
  Gastroesophageal reflux, in which stomach acids abnormally flow back up to the esophagus and throat
  Stomach infections (gastritis) or ulcers
  Certain medications and medical problems that reduce the flow of saliva, thus promoting halitosis
  Pseudo-halitosis, a psychological disorder in which individuals believe they have bad breath although no odor is present."	The symptoms of halitosis vary among individuals, and the extent of the condition ranges from mild to severe. Interestingly, many people with bad breath are completely unaware of their problem.	"To evaluate halitosis, a clinician will subjectively judge a patient’s breath odor. This assessment, called an organoleptic measurement, involves sniffing the patient’s breath as it is exhaled and subjectively rating the severity of the odor. | Gas chromatography (GC) is a test that specifically measures exhaled VSCs, the most common cause of halitosis. |  | When genuine halitosis is detected, patients typically require an examination by a dentist as well as a physician to determine whether the odor is caused by an oral problem, or underlying medical condition, or both. Sometimes, if tonsillitis or sinusitis is suspected, an ear nose and throat specialist is indicated. | Treatment is directed at correcting the underlying causes of halitosis. The most effective interventions are as follows: | Brushing teeth twice daily
  Brushing or scraping the dorsum of the tongue twice daily to reduce the amount of bacteria on the tongue surface
  Flossing daily
  Professional dental cleaning and treatment of gum disease
  Antibacterial mouth wash to reduce some of the bacteria in the mouth (often merely masks odors for a few hours without correcting the underlying problem)
  Lozenges and chewing gum to increase saliva
  Artificial saliva or medications to treat dry mouth
  Proper treatment of uncontrolled medical conditions
  Special psychiatric assessment and counseling for individuals with pseudo-halitosis."	Most cases of halitosis are prevented with the practice of good oral hygiene, including teeth brushing, flossing, tongue cleaning, and abstinence from smoking. A dental examination and professional cleaning are recommended once or twice each year. Additionally, individuals should obtain proper medical care and treatment for any underlying diseases.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hepatitis	"In the general sense, the term “hepatitis” refers to inflammation (swelling) of the liver. The liver’s main job is to filter harmful chemicals and toxins from the blood. It also converts proteins and sugars into useful substances, stores them, and releases them when your body needs them. Inflammation can make it difficult for the liver to perform these functions, leading to illness. | Hepatitis has many causes, including poisoning, bacterial infection and autoimmune conditions (diseases in which the body’s immune system attacks healthy cells). However, it’s most commonly caused by a group of viruses that attack the liver and spread from person to person. |  | The hepatitis viruses can cause acute (sudden, short-term) illness that comes on quickly and lasts a few weeks or months. Some hepatitis viruses also cause chronic (long-term) hepatitis. The chronic form can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure and liver cancer. | Chronic hepatitis affects an estimated 4.4 million Americans. It is a leading cause of liver cancer and the number one reason for liver transplant in the country. | Many people with hepatitis have mild symptoms or none at all. They may go decades or a lifetime without a diagnosis, but can still spread the disease to others. | The most common forms of hepatitis are: | Hepatitis A (HAV), a relatively mild form of acute hepatitis. In rare cases, it can cause acute liver failure (usually in older people or in people who already have liver disease).
  Hepatitis B (HBV), a form of hepatitis that often starts as acute illness but may become chronic in some people.
  Hepatitis C (HDV), which causes acute illness in 20-30 percent of infected persons and chronic illness in 75-85 percent. | Less common forms include: | Hepatitis D (HDV), a virus that only affects people with hepatitis B.
  Hepatitis E (HEV), which is similar to hepatitis A and rare in the United States."	"The hepatitis viruses are transmitted from person to person in different ways: | Hepatitis A (HAV) is spread by ingesting even microscopic amounts of feces from an infected person. This can happen through close personal contact or infected food or water. Raw shellfish that has been contaminated by sewage is a common source of infection.
  Hepatitis B (HBV) is transmitted through contact with the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, vaginal fluid and semen. In the United States, about two-thirds of new adult cases are sexually transmitted. The virus can also be passed from mother to baby during birth.
  Hepatitis C (HDV) is usually spread by contact with infected needles (either during IV drug use or accidental needle sticks) or during childbirth. It’s also sometimes transmitted during sexual contact or by sharing personal hygiene products like shaving razors. You can test for it at home now by ordering a hepatitis C test kit."	"Not all people with hepatitis experience symptoms, and many people with the disease don’t realize they’re infected. When present, symptoms include: | Fever
  Tiredness
  Poor appetite
  Nausea
  Abdominal pain (especially around the liver, which is on the right side below the lower ribs)
  Dark urine
  Clay-colored bowel movements
  Painful joints
  Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)"	"If you think you’ve been exposed to viral hepatitis, seek immediate medical attention. In some cases, your doctor may recommend vaccination or injections of immune globulin (a product containing antibodies made from human blood plasma) to prevent or halt infection. | Hepatitis is diagnosed based on your history and a blood test (or series of tests). Acute infection may last weeks to months. Some people with acute hepatitis need to be hospitalized, but many can remain at home. | Self-care for hepatitis includes: | Get plenty of rest.
  Stay hydrated.
  Eat a balanced, nutritious diet. Choose high-calorie foods if your appetite is poor.
  To protect the liver, avoid alcohol and check with a healthcare professional before taking medications or supplements. | In addition, some people with acute hepatitis C and chronic hepatitis benefit from medications. | People with chronic hepatitis should be monitored regularly by a healthcare provider who understands the condition. To protect the liver, patients should avoid alcohol and check with their provider before taking medications or supplements. | Prognoses (long-term outcomes) vary depending on the form of hepatitis: | Most people with hepatitis A recover fully within two to six months.
  Some people with hepatitis B develop chronic hepatitis. Risk ranges from about 90 percent in infants to 6-10 percent in older children and adults. About 15-25 percent of people with chronic hepatitis B go on to develop serious complications.
  About 75-85 percent of people with hepatitis C develop chronic hepatitis. Of these, 60-70 percent develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent eventually develop cirrhosis; and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In addition, people with hepatitis C are at risk for serious illness if they later develop hepatitis A or B."	"There are many steps you can take to reduce the risk of viral hepatitis: | Consider getting vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if you weren’t vaccinated as a child. This is the number one way to prevent these illnesses.
  Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or changing a baby’s diaper and before handling food.
  When traveling in developing countries, avoid unpeeled or raw foods. Drink only bottled, boiled or chemically treated water.
  Practice safe sex. Hepatitis B is about 50-100 times more transmissible during sex than HIV. Condoms and other barrier methods greatly reduce the risk.
  Never share syringes, shaving razors, toothbrushes or tattooing or piercing supplies.
  Wear gloves when performing first aid.
  Disinfect blood spills (including dried ones) with diluted bleach and wear gloves during cleanup.
  Follow all occupational safety precautions in your workplace.
  If you are pregnant, seek early and regular prenatal care. | To reduce the risk of non-viral hepatitis, avoid excessive alcohol consumption and consult with a healthcare professional about medications and supplements."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hirschsprungs-disease	"Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) is a congenital disease of the large intestine that causes constipation in infants and young children. | Under normal circumstances, muscle contractions move food through the large intestine (also called the colon). Those muscle contractions are controlled by nerve cells that sense food within the colon. In Hirschsprung’s disease, those nerve cells are absent from the colon. A term to describe this kind of missing nerve cells is aganglia. As a result of the disease, food becomes stuck and blocks the colon, worsening the constipation. |  | HD is present from birth and affects roughly 1 out of 5,000 children born. It is five times more common in boys. The disease varies in severity depending on how much of the colon is affected. | In the more common short-segment HD, nerves cells are absent only in the last segment of the colon.
  In long-segment HD, meanwhile, most of the colon is affected.
  In some cases (total colonic aganglionosis), parts of the small intestine are also affected, although this is rare. | Most infants are diagnosed during the first few days after birth because they are unable to pass meconium (newborn stool). Mild cases of Hirschsprung’s disease may be diagnosed at a later age. HD treatment involves removing/bypassing the diseased portion of the colon in order to achieve normal bowel movement. Most children with HD respond well to treatment and live normal adult lives."	"Hirschsprung’s disease is caused by a defect in the migration of nerve cells along the developing colon. This developmental arrest occurs between 5 and 12 weeks of gestation (fetal development in the womb) for reasons that are not fully understood. Normally, the bundles of nerve cells called ganglia constitute the enteric nervous system, which lines the gastrointestinal tract and regulates the movement of content entering the body (as food) and exiting the body (as stool). Without the proper nerve signals, the muscles that push feces through the colon and towards the anus are in effect paralyzed. The risk factors for HD include: | Family history. Some genetic factors have been associated with HD. Therefore, having one child with HD increases the likelihood that other offspring will also have the condition.
  Other inherited/genetic conditions. HD has been linked to other inherited or chromosomal diseases, such as Down syndrome.
  Gender. For reasons that are not known, HD is five times more prevalent in boys."	"HD symptoms are highly dependent on disease severity. In a newborn, the inability to pass stool within 48 hours of birth is an indication of HD. If Hirschsprung’s disease is only present in a small percentage of the colon, symptoms may not appear until an older age. | Newborn symptoms include: | Not having a bowel movement within 48 hours of birth
  Difficulty passing stool
  Excessive gas
  Swollen belly
  Diarrhea
  Poor appetite. | Delayed symptoms in toddlers/older children include: | Worsening constipation
  Gas pain
  Blood-tainted diarrhea
  Swollen belly
  Fecal impaction
  Poor weigh gain
  Malnutrition
  Lack of energy."	"If doctors suspect Hirschsprung’s disease, various tests are performed to examine the colon. | Manual exam. The doctor may press on the belly to feel for bulges associated with impacted stool. A digital rectal exam may also be performed, where a gloved finger is inserted into the rectum.
  X-ray. The combination of X-ray and a contrast agent (barium) allows for visual inspection of the abdominal region. On a typical X-ray image showing HD, a normal functioning proximal colon appears swollen in comparison to the affected distal colon.
  Manometry. Anal manometry looks at muscle conditioning within the colon. This test measures the amount of pressure exerted by the colon onto a balloon that is inserted into the colon.
  Biopsy. A tissue sample collected from the colon may be examined under the microscope. Nerves will be absent in samples from areas affected by HD."	"Surgical removal of the diseased colon and rerouting of the healthy colon to the anus is the most common treatment for Hirschsprung’s disease. Most patients recover fully and achieve normal bowel movement through adulthood. Following surgery, children may continue to experience some symptoms and, depending on age, face challenges during toilet training. The risk of infection is also high following surgery. Without treatment, severe inflammation, infection (enterocolitis) and perforation may occur inside the intestines. | Pull-through. This surgical procedure involves removing the diseased portion of the colon and connecting the healthy proximal colon segment directly to the anus.
  Ostomy. With infants or patients with severe HD, an ostomy is performed first. Once the child has reached age 1 or shows improvement in symptoms, then the pull-through procedure is carried out. With a colostomy, part of the colon is removed, while an ileostomy allows for removal of the entire colon. The healthy portion of the colon is then connected to an opening on the abdomen to form a stoma. The stoma becomes the new exit route for waste, which is collected into a pouch on the outside. The opening in the abdomen is closed later when the intestine is connected to the anus.
  At-home remedies. Regular exercise and a healthy, high-fiber diet of good fats, whole grains, fruits and vegetables help relieve/prevent constipation following surgery. With some or all of the colon removed, the body absorbs less water and can easily become dehydrated; extra fluid intake helps keep the body hydrated. Infants on formula who experience constipation may benefit from changing the brand of formula. | Hirschsprung’s disease is an inherited congenital disease with no means of prevention. Parents of children with HD can avoid serious complications by ensuring early diagnosis and treatment."	"“Hirschsprung’s disease”. Medline Plus.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/ibd	"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refers to those conditions that cause chronic irritation, redness, and swelling (inflammation) of the gastrointestinal tract. | This type of inflammation is associated with a disorder in the body’s immune system. Normally, a healthy immune system protects the body from harmful foreign substances, destroys germs, and prevents infections. In IBD, the body’s immune system 
    
    
    
  malfunctions and mistakenly mounts an attack on food and the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in chronic inflammation in the intestines. This condition leads to tears, sores (ulceration), and destruction of the lining of the intestinal wall. |  | The two main types of IBD are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Crohn’s disease usually affects the lower part of the small intestine (ileum), but it may involve any part of the digestive tract including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. Furthermore, Crohn’s affects every layer of the bowel wall. Ulcerative colitis is distinctly different because it only affects the large intestine (colon) and only involves the inner lining of the bowel. | Inflammatory bowel disease is not the same as irritable bowel syndrome, which involves chronic abdominal symptoms without the intestines having a diseased appearance."	"The cause of inflammatory bowel disease is not known. There is no evidence that emotional stress or any particular food triggers the disease. | Although the actual trigger is unclear, several risk factors are identified: | Exposure to a virus or bacteria that activates the immune system
  Age under 30 with a peak onset between ages 15 to 30
  Cigarette smoking
  Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity
  Family history of a close relative with the disease"	"IBD is a life-long disorder characterized by bouts of recurring symptoms alternating with symptom-free periods known as remissions. | Typical symptoms include: | Abdominal pain and cramping
  Diarrhea
  Bloody stools
  Loss of appetite
  Weight loss
  Fever
  Fatigue | Numerous complications associated with IBD include: | Bowel obstruction due to a thickened intestinal wall or narrow areas of scar tissue (strictures)
  Open sores (ulcers) in the digestive tract
  Gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia
  Intestinal infections and pus accumulation
  Painful anal tears (fissures)
  Fistulas or abnormal tunnels connecting the intestines to nearby organs such as the vagina, bladder, and skin
  Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies secondary to impaired absorption of nutrients
  Weak bones (osteoporosis)
  Increased risk of colon cancer associated with ulcerative colitis"	" | Various tests are used to diagnose IBD: | Blood tests may show anemia resulting from bleeding and an elevated white blood cell count, a sign of inflammation and infection.
  Stool samples are tested for the presence of blood and evidence of infection.
  Colonoscopy is a procedure that uses a flexible video camera to examine the large intestine and display inflammation, bleeding, and ulcers.
  Flexible sigmoidoscopy is similar to a colonoscopy, but the exam is limited to the lower portion of the large intestine (sigmoid colon).
  Computerized tomography (CT) is an X-ray that demonstrates detailed images of the body and may be used to evaluate the intestines.
  X-rays of the intestines are often performed with barium (a white opaque contrast material that enhances the images of hollow structures). | The goal of treatment is to control inflammation, alleviate symptoms, and achieve long-term symptom-free periods of remission. |  | Surgery is necessary when medications can no longer control the disease. Eventually, most patients undergo surgery to remove diseased portions of intestines. Ulcerative colitis, which is confined to the colon, is cured by surgery to remove the rectum and colon (proctocolectomy). Unfortunately, Crohn’s disease may involve any area of the digestive tract, so the disease often recurs in other areas after surgery. | Given the increased risk of developing colon cancer, patients with ulcerative colitis must have routine screening colonoscopies to look for precancerous changes, a definite indication for surgery."	The cause of IBD is unclear, but non-smokers appear to have a lower risk of developing the disease. | While there are no special diets that can prevent inflammatory bowel disease, avoidance of certain foods may improve the symptoms. Dairy products and high-fiber foods may worsen the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/ibs	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of the digestive tract characterized by recurring symptoms of abdominal pain, cramping, and excess gas associated with hard stools (constipation) or watery stools (diarrhea). IBS is not a disease; instead it is considered a functional disorder in which the intestines behave abnormally, but display no visible evidence of disease or damage to the intestinal wall. For patients, this is a long-term condition, but it is not life threatening. |  | IBS is the most common gastrointestinal disorder, affecting 10-15% of the adult population. It is more likely to develop in women than men, and the age of onset is typically under 45. | IBS was sometimes called spastic colon or spastic bowel, due to the presence of abnormal muscle spasms in those suffering from it. However, with greater understanding of the full nature of IBS, these terms are no longer used synonymously with this disorder, since muscle spasms are not necessarily present. | Similarly, IBS is also occasionally called nervous bowel, since the medical community recognized connections between the disorder and psychological factors such as anxiety. Because nervous bowel as a term would appear to address only some of the mental causes of IBS without the observable physical causes, the term does not adequately describe this disorder. | Irritable bowel syndrome differs from inflammatory bowel disease, in which the intestines show visible evidence of disease characterized by chronic inflammation and ulceration of the lining of the intestinal wall.	"The cause of IBS is unknown, but emotional stress, certain foods, and other factors exacerbate the symptoms. | Research offers the following observations: | Emotional stress seems to exacerbate IBS symptoms.
  Psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and panic attacks are more common in people with IBS.
  Abnormal signals from the brain potentially cause intestinal dysfunction.
  Abnormal muscle spasms of the intestinal wall may explain symptoms of abdominal pain and cramping.
  An increased sensitivity to pain could possibly explain the abdominal discomfort.
  Abnormally large numbers of bacteria in the small intestine (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) may produce excess gas and diarrhea.
  Having a relative with IBS increases a person’s chance of developing the condition.
  Certain foods aggravate the symptoms."	With IBS, patients experience repeated episodes of lower abdominal pain, cramping, excess gas, abdominal bloating, and a change in bowel habits (either constipation or diarrhea). Some patients describe a mixture of constipation alternating with diarrhea. | There is no cure for IBS, and many patients experience recurring symptoms over the course of their lifetime.	"IBS is diagnosed when a patient experiences abdominal discomfort occurring three or more times a month over a three-month period in the absence of gastrointestinal disease or injury. The diagnosis is confirmed by a normal physical examination and normal diagnostic test results. | When IBS is suspected, doctors may perform the following diagnostic tests to be sure there is no other gastrointestinal disorder to explain the symptoms: | Blood tests to check for anemia (low number of red blood cells).
  Stool samples to detect intestinal bleeding or infection.
  Lower gastrointestinal series (an X-ray to examine the large intestine).
  Colonoscopy (a procedure which uses a flexible camera to view the colon). Alternatively, a sigmoidoscopy is a similar procedure where the doctor inspects only the lower portion of the large intestine (sigmoid colon).
  There is also a newer option that can lead to good clarity. It’s a blood test that checks for evidence of a particular response to prior gastroenteritis or food poisoning; evidence has shown a strong connection between this and IBS (though not in all patients). The test can either be administered in a doctor’s office or at your home. Learn more about this IBS blood test and whether it’s a good option for you. | The X-rays and colonoscopy are not performed unless a patient has alarming signs and symptoms such as anemia, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. If a patient is over age 50 and has symptoms of IBS, a colonoscopy is usually performed to check for colon cancer. | Because there is no cure for IBS, the goal of treatment is to control a patient’s predominant symptoms. The cornerstones of treatment are dietary and lifestyle changes, medications, probiotics, and mental health therapy. Surgery has no benefit and should be avoided. | Avoidance of foods that aggravate symptoms. Examples are milk, wheat, alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages, artificial sweeteners, red peppers, green onions, and gas-forming foods like beans and cabbage. There is no universally successful diet for IBS, so patients need to experiment with eliminating various foods.
  High-fiber foods such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains help soften the stool and relieve constipation.
  Psyllium, a high-fiber dietary supplement, relieves constipation by adding bulk and softening the stool. Bloating is a potential problem with this product.
  Exercise
  Stress reduction
  Relaxation techniques such as meditation
  Avoidance of smoking | Laxatives treat constipation and increased bowel movements.
  Antidiarrheal medications help stop diarrhea.
  Antispasmodic medications decrease the muscle contractions in the bowel walls and may help relieve abdominal pain and cramping.
  Probiotics (healthy bacteria for the gastrointestinal tract) may decrease the symptoms.
  Certain antidepressant medications relieve pain in some patients. | For some patients, therapies for psychological disorders may also relieve their IBS symptoms by addressing the emotional stress and mental problems linked to the condition. Psychotherapy involves exploring a patient’s thoughts and maladaptive behaviors and identifying effective coping techniques. | Acupuncture (an alternative therapy that involves sticking the skin with small needles) may help alleviate IBS symptoms, but further studies are needed."	The cause of IBS is not well understood and effective preventive measures are not established. Researchers believe that both physical and mental health problems impact this condition. Although there is no cure for IBS, the condition is not life threatening and symptoms can improve with a range of dietary, medical, and mental health treatments.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones	Kidney stones (also known as renal lithiasis) are hardened material found inside the kidneys, and are made of crystallized minerals and salts. They can occur anywhere along the urinary tract, between the kidney and bladder, and vary in shape and size - some are as large as a golf ball. The main cause of kidney stones is a lack of fluids, which allows salts and minerals to concentrate and crystallize over the course of weeks to months. Passing a stone can be painful and may even require surgery. Approximately 1 in 11 Americans have kidney stones, with data showing an increasing trend in the prevalence of this disease.	"The lack of proper hydration signified by producing less than 1 liter of urine daily is the primary cause of kidney stone disease. Urine is largely made up of water, which acts as the solvent for calcium, oxalate, uric acid, and other crystal-forming substances found in urine. Without ample water, urine becomes supersaturated allowing these components to fall out of solution and crystallize. The cause usually depends on the type of kidney stone, as summarized below: | Calcium stones. The most common of kidney stones are made of calcium, usually in the form of calcium oxalate, and sometimes, calcium phosphate. Calcium is derived from diet and is required for muscle function and bone mass. Excess calcium is excreted in the urine, where it can combine with oxalate. Certain fruits and vegetables, vitamin supplements, and metabolic disorders can lead to increased levels of oxalate.
  Struvite stones. Struvite (phosphate mineral) stones are associated with bacterial infections of the urinary tract. Ammonia-producing bacteria are believed to enable crystallization by increasing the pH of urine. Struvite stones can become large enough to block in the urinary tract.
  Uric acid stones. Uric acid stones are more common in men and are linked to a high-protein diet. They may also occur in individuals with gout.
  Cystine stones. These stones develop in individuals with a hereditary condition called cystinuria, in which an excess of the amino acid cystine leaks into the urine. | Other risk factors for kidney stone disease include a family history of the disease, diet, and certain medical conditions. | Disease history. Individuals with past kidney stones or with a family history of kidney stones are at a greater risk.
  Diet. Foods that are high in animal protein, sodium, and sugar are linked to a greater risk of developing kidney stones.
  Medical conditions. Digestive diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic diarrhea, and conditions like hyperparathyroidism can increase the risk of kidney stones.
  Age and gender. Kidney stones are common in adults over the age of 40, and more prevalent in men."	"Small kidney stones are generally asymptomatic and may be cleared through urine with little to no pain. Large kidney stones that block the path of urine can cause more severe symptoms, such as: | Sharp pain in the abdomen or lower back
  Blood in the urine
  Painful urination
  Nausea and vomiting
  Fever and chills
  Abnormally colored urine."	" | The first step in diagnosing kidney stones is a physical exam and an assessment of known risk factors. Next, the following tests may be performed to detect the stones and identify the cause: | Blood test. Blood tests look for elevated levels of crystal-forming substances (uric acid and calcium) in the blood, and also evaluate kidney function.
  Urinalysis. This test measures the levels of crystal-forming and crystal-inhibiting components in urine, and detects actual kidney stone. Urinalysis also tests for a urinary tract infection, which can lead to struvite stones.
  Imaging. Kidney stones or a blockage along the urinary tract are visualized by computerized tomography (CT), X-ray, or ultrasound techniques. | Treatment options for kidney stones depend on the type of stone and level of discomfort. Small stones can be passed from the body by drinking plenty of water (over 2 liters daily) and using pain medication (over-the-counter or prescription), as needed. The following are common treatments for patients with large stones or severe symptoms: | Medication. Some kidney stones can be broken apart or dissolved using diuretics, phosphate solution, or sodium bicarbonate. Allopurinol is used to treat uric acid stones, while antibiotics help treat the cause of struvite stones. Medications that relax the ureter muscles may be prescribed to help pass kidney stones.
  Shock wave lithotripsy. This procedure helps break up larger stones by using strong sound vibrations. Once crushed, the small crystal fragments can be passed through urine.
  Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. During this surgical procedure, a thin tool is passed through the patient’s back and into the kidney, where it can remove kidney stones.
  Uteroscopy. A uteroscope is a thin, lighted tube equipped with a camera to visualize kidney stones. The device is inserted into the urinary tract through the urethra, where it can remove small stones, or break them apart using energy from a laser."	Proper hydration is the best preventative measure for kidney stone disease. Individuals who have had kidney stones can help prevent a recurrence by altering their diet. For example, limiting animal proteins helps prevent uric acid and calcium stones, while reducing high-oxalate foods (e.g. spinach) and sodium helps prevent calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones, respectively. Depending on the type of stone, modifications to existing medications may also help prevent recurrence.	"“Kidney stones”. Medline Plus. NIH. Oct 2013.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/liver-cysts	Liver cysts (also called hepatic cysts) are fluid-filled sacs that occur in the liver of roughly 5% of the population. They are usually asymptomatic and often discovered by chance during an abdominal imaging procedure, like computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Even though most liver cysts are benign, an early diagnosis is critical for proper treatment of the parasitic or cancerous subtypes. In most cases, treatment involves removal via minimally invasive surgical techniques.	" | Liver cysts fall into several categories with varying causes, diagnoses, and treatments. | Simple cysts are present from birth and are formed by abnormal bile duct cells during the embryo’s development. Cysts contain a bile-like fluid and are covered with a thin layer of epithelial cells. They are the most common type of liver cyst and generally measure less than 3 cm in diameter.
  Echinococcosis is an infection by a species of tapeworm that is transmissible between animals and humans. Specifically, the larval stage of the Echinococcus granulosus (E. granulosus) and Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis) species produces liver cysts in humans. Humans become infected by ingesting the parasite’s eggs, which are found in the excrement of the animal host (e.g. sheep and dogs). Echinococcosis is still not common in the United States, though it has nevertheless become more common over the past several decades in both the U.S. and Europe. It could become gradually more common as wild animals like foxes become more prevalent in areas where people live and keep pets.
  Cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma represent benign and cancerous cystic tumors, respectively. Cystadenomas are similar to simple cysts in that they are of epithelial origin and present from birth. The mechanism by which the cystic tumors become cancerous is not known. Cystadenocarcinomas grow slowly and have a mean diameter of 12 cm.
  Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare genetic disorder signified by the presence of greater than 20 liver cysts. The cysts are present from birth and cluster together. PLD is closely associated with two other disorders: autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (PCLD) and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)."	Liver cysts generally do not affect liver function and may remain asymptomatic for years. When cysts become enlarged, they can rupture or push against other organs, causing bloating, a feeling of fullness, and a sudden pain in the upper right abdominal region. Parasitic cysts (echinococcosis) may also cause fever, bloody sputum, and severe skin itching. The type of echinococcosis caused by E. multilocularis (called alveolar echinococcosis) can cause symptoms similar to cirrhosis or liver cancer. | 	"Liver cysts are primarily diagnosed (often by chance) using imaging techniques such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI. A physician may also perform a physical exam of the abdomen to feel for cysts. Cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed using immunodiagnostic tests that detect Echinococcus antibodies in the blood. | Most cysts do not require treatment and go away on their own. Symptomatic cysts that become enlarged or malignant are removed surgically. Fluid drainage is also performed, but the effect is only temporary. In some PLD patients, liver transplantation is required. | Surgery. Complete removal of liver cysts is the best method of treatment, especially with cases of cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma. This is done using laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgical procedure where instruments are delivered to the surgery site through thin tubes inserted into the abdomen.
  Drug therapy. Parasitic cysts caused by echinococcosis are often treated with a combination of surgery and up to two years of chemotherapy to reduce symptoms. A course of drugs to treat parasitic worms may also be prescribed."	Liver cyst disorders that are congenital (present from birth) or inherited are not preventable. A family history of liver cysts is a good indicator of the likelihood of developing this condition. | Parasitic cysts can be avoided by practicing good hygiene and proper food handling in parts of the world where Echinococcus infections are common, such as Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. In the United States, such precautions are advisable particularly for those who keep indoor/outdoor pets. Additionally, hunters should always wear gloves when handling wild animals.	"“Liver Cysts”.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/obesity	An obese person has more body fat than what is considered normal for his or her height. Although sometimes used interchangeably, the term “overweight” refers to increased body weight from fat, muscle, bone and fluids, while “obese” only refers to excess fat. | Obesity, which is the disease of carrying excess fat, affects one third of Americans (about 78.6 million) and is a leading cause of mortality and soaring healthcare costs in the country. This is because obesity increases the risk of developing a myriad of chronic diseases including heart disease, high cholesterol, hypertension, liver disease, type 2 diabetes, respiratory disorders, sexual dysfunction, osteoarthritis and some cancers. Additionally, obese people are more likely to suffer from depression, social isolation and physical limitations. | Obesity is the result of an imbalance between calorie intake and calorie expenditure. Genetics, a high-calorie diet and low physical activity are all contributors to a buildup of body fat. Dietary and lifestyle trends that cause obesity are showing global impact, with both adulthood and childhood obesity on the rise around the world. Over the last 30 years in the United States, the numbers of obese children in the 6-11 and 12-19 age groups have more than doubled and quadrupled, respectively. | With lifestyle changes and medication, it is possible to achieve a healthy weight and avoid secondary diseases; even modest weight loss can delay or prevent associated complications. Surgical procedures that force a limit on the amount of food intake or slow fat absorption are also available.	"The body stores excess fat as a result of too much caloric intake and a lack of calorie expenditure through physical activity. Poor diet and inactivity are often influenced by environmental factors like community behavior and socioeconomics. Genetics and other health conditions may also play a role. Known causes and risk factors for obesity include: | Poor diet. An unbalanced diet with few fruits/vegetables and a disproportionally high amount of fat and added sugars (such as from fast foods and sodas) - consuming more calories than what the body needs, and choosing nutrient-poor foods rather than nutritious foods - causes weight gain.
  Sedentary lifestyle. Regular physical activity burns calories gained through diet. Poor health, disability, occupation or other conditions that bring about prolonged inactivity cause obesity.
  Family. Children with obese parents are more likely to become obese themselves because they generally adopt a similar diet and lifestyle.
  Socioeconomics. Easy access to outdoor space and healthy foods can greatly influence the overall health of a community. Cities with sidewalks and public transportation encourage walking or biking, which help burn calories. Importantly, low-income families are more likely to choose low-cost fast foods that are rich in calories.
  Genetics. Evidence suggests that genes may play a role in hunger, fat storage and calorie expenditure in some obese individuals.
  Illness. Some medical conditions like Prader-Willi syndrome and Cushing’s syndrome are linked to obesity.
  Medication. Steroid and beta blocker drugs and some medications used for treating depression, diabetes and seizures can cause excess weight gain.
  Pregnancy. Pregnant women who necessarily gain weight during pregnancy, but then have trouble losing the weight or continue to gain weight post-pregnancy, are at risk of becoming obese.
  Age. The risk of obesity grows with age due to inactivity and decreased muscle mass, both of which lead to weight gain."	"The symptoms of obesity include: | High body mass index (BMI)
  An expanding waistline
  Gaining weight
  Switching to larger sized clothing."	"Doctors diagnose obesity by performing a general exam and learning about the patient’s personal/family medical history. The body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference are routinely used to estimate “fatness”. The BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (kilograms) by the square of their height (meters); it is solely an estimate and not a direct measurement for body fat. The BMI is associated with weight in the following way: | BMI is below 18.5 = Underweight
  BMI is 18.5-24.9 = Normal weight
  BMI is 25.0-29.9 = Overweight
  BMI is 30.0 or more = Obese. | Excess abdominal fat is also reflected in the waist circumference. The risk of obesity and related complications increases when the waist circumference measures over 35 inches for women, and over 40 inches in men. | Obesity is treated by achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through a combination of diet, exercise, medication and, in some cases, surgery. At-risk or obese children are encouraged to eat healthy and increase physical activity. Obese adults are advised to lose 5-10 percent of their body weight as an initial step in a comprehensive treatment plan that includes: | Dietary changes. Choosing healthy foods and reducing caloric intake are key to losing weight. The ideal diet is low in cholesterol and saturated fats, and includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats. The recommended number of daily food calories varies for each person but is roughly 1,000-1,200 calories per day for women, and 1,200-1,600 calories per day for men.
  Physical activity. Doing 150-300 minutes of moderate to intense exercise per week will help remove excess weight and maintain a healthy weight. Simple changes in habit that encourage more movement (e.g. gardening) also help burn calories.
  Behavior changes. It is important to identify and manage the triggers of hunger or unnecessary snacking. Counseling and support groups can facilitate this process and help patients manage their food cravings.
  Medication. Obese patients who cannot reduce their weight with diet and exercise alone are candidates for prescription drugs that curb hunger or reduce fat absorption.
  Surgery. Extremely obese patients or those with serious weight-related complications may consider weight-lost surgery. Although surgery offers excellent results with respect to weight loss and maintenance, it carries important risks. Surgical procedures work by either reducing the stomach’s holding capacity (gastric banding, gastric sleeve), reducing fat absorption through the small intestine (biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch), or both (gastric bypass)."	The best way to maintain a healthy weight is through regular exercise and a balanced diet that is low in saturated fats and added sugars. It is also important to address medical or environmental factors that trigger hunger and inactivity.	"“Obesity”. The Obesity Society.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis	"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which is a gland located in the upper part of the abdomen near the stomach, liver and gallbladder. Inflammation refers to the body’s response to injury, infection or irritating substances. When the pancreas is inflamed, it may become swollen and sore and lose its ability to function properly. | One job of the pancreas is to produces digestive enzymes, which it secretes into the small intestine through the pancreatic duct. These enzymes activate in the presence of bile, a substance that is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Activated digestive enzymes break down food so nutrients can be absorbed into the body. In addition, the pancreas also makes insulin, a hormone that helps the body’s cells convert blood glucose (sugar) into energy. |  | Pancreatitis can begin as an acute illness, meaning that it comes on strong and suddenly, then goes away after a couple days of treatment. In some cases, pancreatitis is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes irreversible scarring, tissue damage and loss of pancreatic function. | Both forms of the disease can cause potentially serious complications, including: | Death of the pancreatic tissue
  Formation of fluid-filled pockets (pseudocysts)
  Internal bleeding
  Infection that spreads to other parts of the body, resulting in shock and organ failure
  Trouble breathing
  Diabetes (due to insufficient insulin production)
  Kidney failure
  Chronic pain
  Malnutrition
  Increased risk of pancreatic cancer"	"About 210,000 people are hospitalized each year with pancreatitis. Men and people of African descent are at increased risk for the condition. Pancreatitis is most common between the ages of 35 and 64. Other risk factors include heavy drinking, smoking, family history of pancreatitis, and family history of high blood cholesterol and/or triglycerides. | Normally, digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas activate in the small intestine. However, when the pancreas or bile ducts are irritated, these enzymes may activate early inside the pancreas itself. The activated enzyme is an irritant and provokes an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissues. | Gallstones and alcoholism are the two most common causes of acute pancreatitis, accounting for about 80 percent of all cases. Gallstones are small “pebbles” of hardened bile. The liver and gallbladder (which produce and store bile, respectively) share a common duct system with the pancreas. Hepatic ducts from the liver merge with the cystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. Further down this common bile duct, the pancreatic duct also merges with it to form the ampulla of Vater, which connects to the duodenum where the juices from these organs work to digest food. Gallstones in the common bile duct may irritate the pancreas by impeding flow in the pancreatic duct. | Heavy, chronic use of alcohol can also cause irritation. | Other causes of acute pancreatitis include: | Medications (corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories)
  Some infections (mumps, hepatitis, mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus)
  Abdominal injury or recent surgery
  Tumors
  Genetic abnormalities of the pancreas | The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is chronic, heavy alcohol use. Other causes include: | Smoking
  Medications
  Cystic fibrosis
  Hyperthyroidism
  High blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels
  Hereditary disorders such as hemochromatosis (DNA health testing can help you discover your genetic risk)
  Autoimmune disease
  Pancreatic cancer | In about 10 percent of pancreatitis cases, the cause is never diagnosed. Cases of pancreatitis where diagnostic procedures cannot establish a cause are called idiopathic."	"Signs of acute pancreatitis include: | Pain in the upper abdomen that may radiate to the back or feel worse after eating (pain is often sudden and severe)
  Nausea
  Vomiting
  Swollen or tender abdomen
  Fever
  Rapid pulse | The following symptoms are associated with chronic pancreatitis: | Pain in the upper abdomen (usually less intense than in the acute form)
  Vomiting
  Unexplained weight loss
  Diarrhea
  Oily stools"	" | Lab tests are often the first step in diagnosing pancreatitis. These include blood tests to detect increased pancreatic enzyme levels and stool tests to check for poor absorption of fats. | Imaging tests are used to determine the size of the pancreas and detect related problems like gallstones: | CT scan uses X-rays to create three-dimensional images of organs.
  Ultrasound uses reflected sound waves to create an image. These may be directed through the abdominal wall or via a tube called an endoscope that is passed down the throat. Endoscopy is usually performed under light sedation.
  Magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, uses magnetic fields to create detailed pictures of body structures. | Most people who are diagnosed with pancreatitis are hospitalized. The main goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and treat any infection that may be present. Treatment usually includes: | Fasting or tube feeding to give the pancreas a rest.
  Pain medications.
  Antibiotics (if infection is present).
  IV fluids. | Further treatment depends on the underlying causes of the pancreatitis: | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). In this procedure, an endoscope, or tube with a tiny camera in the end, is passed down the throat and used to examine the pancreas and bile ducts. Tools can be passed through the scope to relieve blockages and drain fluid.
  Cholecystectomy. Surgical removal of the gallbladder may help people whose pancreatitis is caused by gallstones.
  Pancreatic surgery. This is sometimes needed to remove diseased tissue or drain fluid-filled cysts. | People with chronic pancreatitis may require: | Pain management with medication or surgical techniques.
  Enzyme supplements taken by mouth.
  Insulin injections.
  A low-fat diet that’s also nutrient-rich. | Patients diagnosed with pancreatitis can help manage the condition and prevent its return through healthy lifestyle choices. One of the most important is to seek treatment for alcoholism. A primary care physician can provide referrals to appropriate programs. Patients may also benefit from smoking cessation, drinking plenty of fluids, limiting caffeine intake and eating a low-fat diet. | About 85 percent of acute pancreatitis cases are mild and clear up after a few days of treatment. Tissue death, or pancreatic necrosis, occurs in 15 to 20 percent of acute cases. This type usually requires surgical treatment and is more prone to complications. | The mortality rate for acute pancreatitis is about 5 percent. Most deaths are related to systemic infection and organ failure. | When the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol-related, the probability of recurrence is about 50 percent if the person continues to drink."	Not all cases of pancreatitis are preventable. However, the most important thing a person can do to prevent the disease is to limit alcohol intake. It’s especially important to avoid binge drinking (consuming several drinks close together). | In addition, quitting smoking may also reduce the risk of pancreatitis.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcers	A peptic ulcer is an open sore that results when sensitive tissue in the digestive tract is exposed to acid. Peptic ulcers are typically found in the stomach (where they are called gastric ulcers) and duodenum (the beginning of the small intestine, where they are called duodenal ulcers), but can also less commonly occur in the esophagus. | The two most common causes of peptic ulcers in the United States are bacterial infection and a specific class of anti-inflammatory drugs, both of which compromise the protective lining of the gastrointestinal tract. In severe cases, peptic ulcers can obstruct the passage of food into the duodenum, or lead to cancer. Half a million Americans develop peptic ulcer disease each year.	" | The main causes of peptic ulcers are the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and a class of drugs referred to as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Smoking and alcohol use increase the chances of developing ulcers, especially when combined with the above risk factors. Despite common belief, spicy foods do not cause ulcers; they only worsen the symptoms of existing ulcers. | H. pylori. This Gram-negative bacterium is responsible for roughly 50% of peptic ulcers, but not every infected individual develops an ulcer. Following an infection, H. pylori colonizes on the stomach wall where it damages the mucous membrane. Without this protective barrier the sensitive lining of the stomach and duodenum are exposed to digestive acids, resulting in ulcers.
  NSAIDs. Frequent use of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and other NSAIDs - used to treat inflammation, pain, and fever - can lead to ulcers, mainly in the stomach. In fact, regular use of NSAIDs is associated with a five times greater risk of developing peptic ulcers. NSAIDs act by blocking the activity of cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, which produce pain-promoting prostaglandins. However, by doing so they also prevent the synthesis of prostaglandins that serve a protective role in the stomach’s lining, hence the higher risk of peptic ulcers. This risk increases depending on the number of NSAIDs, dosage, age, sex, medical history, and other habits like alcohol use and smoking."	"Abdominal pain is the most common symptom of peptic ulcer disease. The pain may follow meals, last for varying lengths of time, and be reoccurring. Patients also experience nighttime pain that can be managed by eating, or taking antacids. Other symptoms include: | Nausea and vomiting
  Poor appetite
  Weight loss
  Bloating
  Burping | Symptoms that require immediate medical attention are associated with bleeding and they include: | Sudden sharp abdominal pain
  Blood in the stool or vomit
  Dark-colored stool or vomit
  Fatigue
  Lightheadedness"	"Peptic ulcers are diagnosed based on the symptoms, and in some cases, using invasive techniques that survey the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. If the patient is not taking NSAIDs, various techniques are used to test for the presence of H. pylori. | Endoscopy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), also known as upper endoscopy, is performed to inspect the stomach and duodenum for ulcers. The procedure uses a long flexible tube to deliver a small, lighted camera down the GI tract. If necessary, a small tissue sample is removed for further study, or medicine is delivered to stop bleeding.
  Upper GI series (barium swallow). This outpatient procedure uses X-ray imaging to examine the upper GI tract for ulcers. Prior to the X-ray, the patient drinks a thick chalky liquid contrast agent containing barium, to allow for visualization.
  H. pylori. To confirm an H. pylori infection in patients not taking NSAIDs, one of three non-invasive methods is performed. A blood test checks for the presence of anti-_H. pylori_ antibodies. Stool tests check for the presence of H. pylori antigens (proteins that elicit a host immune response). In a “urea breath test,” the patient drinks carbon-labeled urea, which is processed by the gut H. pylori into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide carries the labeled carbon and is detected when exhaled. | Peptic ulcers are fully treatable by removing their main cause (H. pylori or NSAIDs) and controlling their acidic environment. | Antimicrobials. H. pylori is treated with a 10-14 day course of antibiotics. Completing the course is critical for preventing the emergence of antibiotic-resistance strains of H. pylori.
  Medication switching. Patients taking NSAIDs must reduce their daily dosage, or switch to alternate medication in order to promote healing and prevent reoccurrence.
  Other medication. Prescription proton-pump inhibitors and H2-receptor blockers lessen pain and allow healing by reducing acid production in the stomach. They are often prescribed in conjunction with other therapies for peptic ulcers."	Peptic ulcers are best prevented by reducing the risk of infection with H. pylori. Frequent handwashing and proper food handling help prevent the spread of harmful bacterial, including H. pylori. If NSAIDs cannot be avoided, then the lowest effective dosage is recommended. Smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are not advisable.	"“NSAIDs and Peptic Ulcers”. National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC). NIH. Nov 2013.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/uti	A urinary tract infection, or UTI, is an infection of any part of the urinary system, the group of organs that removes water and waste products from the blood. |  | About 95 percent of UTIs involve the lower urinary tract. This includes the bladder (the organ that collects and holds urine) and the urethra (the tube through which urine exits the body). Lower urinary tract infections are also called cystitis. They can be quite painful, but usually don’t cause permanent damage. | Sometimes cystitis spreads to the upper urinary tract, causing a more serious infection called pyelonephritis. This can affect the kidneys (the organs that remove excess water and waste products from the blood) and the ureters (the tubes that connect the kidneys and bladder). In acute (sudden, short-term) pyelonephritis, there is a risk that bacteria will enter the blood stream, causing a life-threatening condition called septicemia. Chronic (long-term) pyelonephritis can cause scarring and permanent damage to the kidneys. | UTIs are four times more common in women than in men. This is because women have a shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to spread easily to the bladder. Also, for women the urethra is a shorter distance from the anus, a common source of infection. | While UTIs are less common in men, they tend to be more severe when they do occur.	A UTI begins when disease-causing microorganisms enter the urinary tract through the urethra. Usually the body’s immune system can fight off these invaders, but if they multiply too quickly, they can overwhelm the body’s natural defenses. The most common cause of UTIs is bacteria called Escherichia coli (E. coli) that lives in the human bowel. | Bacteria often multiply in the urinary tract when a person doesn’t urinate frequently enough. (Urination washes bacteria out of the body.) Infrequent urination may be due to a medical condition such as a kidney stone or blockage or simply to personal habits. | Frequent sexual activity also contributes to the development of UTIs, especially for women. The friction of sexual intercourse can push bacteria into the urethra. Nearly 80 percent of UTIs in young women occur shortly after sexual intercourse. Women who use a diaphragm or spermicide for birth control are at especially high risk, as both encourage the growth of excess bacteria. | People with diabetes or conditions that suppress the immune system may have a harder time fighting off harmful bacteria and consequently may experience more UTIs. | Changes in estrogen levels at menopause thin the lining of the urinary tract, which creates small tears in which bacteria can grow. | Pregnant women are at increased risk for pyelonephritis, which increases the chances of premature birth and low birth weight for the baby.	"Not all urinary tract infections cause symptoms. Those that don’t usually clear up on their own without treatment. | Common symptoms of cystitis include: | A strong, urgent need to urinate that persists even when the bladder is emptied
  Pain or burning during urination
  Frequently passing small amounts of urine
  Urine is cloudy, red, pink or brownish
  Urine has an unusual smell
  Pain or pressure in the lower belly (women)
  Rectal and lower abdominal pain (men)
  Fatigue
  Fever. | Additional symptoms of pyelonephritis include: | Upper back and side pain
  Fever and chills
  Nausea and vomiting."	" | Because of the risk of complications, it’s important to see a doctor promptly if you have signs of a UTI. In most cases your primary care doctor can effectively diagnose and treat this condition. | UTIs are usually diagnosed based on medical history and a lab test called urinalysis. During urinalysis, a urine sample is examined under a microscope to determine the presence of bacteria and white and red blood cells. | For severe or recurrent infections, the doctor may order a urine culture. This involves placing drops of urine into several different mediums. Each medium encourages the growth of a different bacterium. Within a few days, the lab can identify the bacteria causing the infection and test its sensitivity to various antibiotics. | Patients with recurrent UTIs may be referred to a urologist, a physician who specializes in treating diseases of the urinary tract. The urologist can perform imaging and mechanical tests to determine the underlying cause of the infections, including: | Bladder and kidney ultrasound - This imaging test uses reflected sound waves to create pictures of the urinary tract and organs. It’s used to check for blockages, stones, inflammation or other underlying structural issues.
  Voiding cystourethragram - A catheter is passed up the urethra into the bladder and a liquid contrast medium (dye) is injected. X-rays are then taken of the bladder both while it’s full and during urination. This test shows whether the bladder is emptying completely during urination.
  CT scan - The patient is placed inside a special type of X-ray machine that creates three-dimensional images of body structures, including the urinary tract.
  MRI - This imaging procedure uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to create three-dimensional images.
  Radionuclide scan - A small amount of a radioactive chemical is injected into the patient’s blood. A special camera is then used to image the blood as it passes through the kidneys.
  Urodynamic testing - These tests check mechanical function of the bladder and sphincter muscles. They’re especially good at detecting issues caused by nerve damage.
  Cytoscopy - A small tube with a camera in its end is inserted from the urethra into the bladder. | Treatment | Urinary tract infections are treated with antibiotics, a class of medications that kill bacteria. The type of antibiotic prescribed depends on which bacteria cause the infection. Though most people feel better within one or two days of beginning antibiotics, it’s important to finish the entire course. In cases of severe infection, intravenous antibiotics may be administered at the hospital. | People with UTIs may also benefit from certain analgesics (pain killers) that numb the bladder and help make urination more comfortable. These are available both in prescription form and over the counter. Discolored urine is a common but harmless side effect. | Patients can also promote healing by drinking plenty of water and avoiding coffee, alcohol and other substances that irritate the bladder. Applying a warm heating pad to the stomach may help relieve abdominal pain. | In most cases, cystitis clears up completely following a course of antibiotics. However, recurrence is a problem. About one in five young women who has a UTI will have another within a year, and about 3-5 percent of women experience them several times a year. In men, disease-causing bacteria can “hide” in the prostate tissue, causing inflammation and recurring infections."	"There are many steps you can take to reduce your risk of a UTI: | After a bowel movement, wipe from front to back to avoid moving bacteria from the anus toward the urethra.
  Try to avoid holding your urine for extended periods of time. Go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the urge.
  Women should pass urine soon after sex to flush away bacteria that may have been pushed into the urethra. Drinking a full glass of water afterwards doesn’t hurt either.
  Stay well hydrated. Drink 6-8 glasses of clear liquids each day.
  Avoid douches and feminine hygiene sprays because these can irritate the urethra.
  Women with recurrent UTIs may want to consider switching their form of birth control. Diaphragms, spermicides and condoms containing spermicide can all promote bacterial growth and provoke frequent infections.
  Take showers instead of tub baths.
  Wear cotton underwear and loose-fitting pants or skirts.
  If you’re approaching menopause, ask your doctor about hormone replacement therapy.
  If you experience recurrent UTIs related to sexual intercourse, ask your doctor about antibiotics to be taken after sex.
  Results of a 2012 meta-analysis (analysis of previous studies) suggest that drinking cranberry juice may help prevent UTIs, especially in women who experience recurrent UTIs."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/diabetes-mellitus	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common disease in which the blood sugar (glucose) is abnormally elevated. Normally, the body obtains glucose from food, and additional glucose is made in the liver. The pancreas produces insulin, which enables glucose to enter cells and serve as fuel for the body. In patients with diabetes, glucose accumulates in the blood instead of being properly transported into cells. Excess blood sugar is a serious problem that may damage the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and other organs. | About 5-10% of patients with diabetes are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, causing the organ to no longer produce insulin. Type 1 DM most commonly occurs in children or young adults, and the incidence of new cases is increasing. |  | Approximately 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes mellitus, which occurs when the body becomes unable to use the insulin produced by the pancreas. This condition is also called insulin resistance. The prevalence of type 2 DM is increasing dramatically worldwide. In the past, type 2 DM was associated with adulthood; however, it is rapidly increasing in children because of the rise in childhood obesity. | Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs during pregnancy. This form of diabetes usually resolves after delivery, but patients with GDM have an increased risk of developing type 2 DM later in life.	"Type 1 DM is an autoimmune disorder and the exact cause is unknown. Causes may include genetic factors, environmental factors, and viruses. | For type 2 DM, the major risk factors include a family history of type 2 DM, increased age, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 DM can develop in people who are not obese, but obesity is a major risk factor because excess body fat causes insulin resistance. | Gestational diabetes mellitus is caused by certain hormones associated with pregnancy that interfere with insulin’s function. GDM occurs more frequently in patients who are overweight, are older than 25, have close relatives with diabetes, or have given birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds. | Steroid medication may cause diabetes or exacerbate existing disease. | DM is also caused by: | Excess hormone production
  Pancreatic diseases
  Genetic factors—among them, hereditary hemochromatosis, one of the most common hereditary conditions; learn about DNA health testing to find out how you can test to discover your own risk."	"People with type 1 DM usually experience a sudden onset of symptoms including: | Frequent urination
  Extreme thirst
  Weight loss
  Abnormal hunger
  Fatigue
  Blurred vision. | The severity of symptoms depends on the blood sugar level. Individuals with type 2 DM usually have a much more gradual onset of symptoms, and many people with type 2 DM are asymptomatic for years. | Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening condition associated with increased fat metabolism and production of harmful acids (ketones). Patients diagnosed with DKA develop very high blood sugar levels, abdominal pain, fruity-smelling breath, dehydration, severe weakness, lethargy, and coma.
  Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome is characterized by extremely high blood sugar levels, dehydration, fever, confusion, and coma.
  Atherosclerosis causes the narrowing of arteries throughout the body. This problem increases the risk for coronary heart disease, heart attacks, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, and impaired circulation to the legs (peripheral artery disease).
  Damage to nerves (neuropathy) in the arms and legs causes decreased sensation, numbness, and tingling. Neuropathy and poor blood circulation in the feet can cause non-healing wounds and infections that may necessitate lower extremity amputations.
  Damage to blood vessels in the kidney ultimately impairs kidney function (nephropathy).
  Impaired blood flow in the retina (diabetic retinopathy) can lead to blindness."	"Patients with type 1 DM often develop pronounced symptoms of diabetes, so the disease is usually readily diagnosed. Conversely, people with type 2 DM may experience no symptoms. Screening tests are important for high risk groups, such as pregnant women, people with a family history of diabetes, and people older than 45. | Prediabetes is a condition of mildly elevated blood glucose levels found in people at risk for developing type 2 DM. Prediabetes is often diagnosed upon routine screening of otherwise asymptomatic individuals. With early lifestyle changes, prediabetes is reversible. | Fasting blood glucose is measured after an 8 hour fast. | Normal: less than 100 mg/dl
  Prediabetes: 100-125 mg/dl
  Diabetes: 126 mg/dl or higher | Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed after consumption of a high-glucose solution. | Normal: less than 140 mg/dl
  Prediabetes: 140-199 mg/dl
  Diabetes: 200 mg/dl or higher | Random blood glucose of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. | Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is an indicator of a person’s average blood sugar for the past 2 or 3 months. The test measures the percent of hemoglobin adherent to glucose molecules. | Normal: less that 5.7%
  Prediabetes: 5.7-6.4%
  Diabetes: 6.5% or higher | Treatment | Patients with diabetes are advised to reduce their consumption of refined carbohydrates and adhere to a high-fiber, low-fat, and low-calorie diet. Daily aerobic exercise is recommended because exercise naturally lowers blood sugars and helps control the disease. | Insulin therapy is absolutely essential for most patients with type 1 DM, and insulin is also required in some cases of type 2 DM. Insulin is administered by injections or an insulin pump.
  Oral glucose-lowering medications work to lower blood sugar by either stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin; inhibiting glucose production by the liver; enhancing the body’s response to insulin; or blocking digestive enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates.
  Pancreas transplants may be performed in patients when treatment with medications fails. | All patients with diabetes must monitor their blood glucose levels to verify that the diabetes is under control. The frequency of monitoring depends on the type of medication a patient uses. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is a serious adverse effect of diabetic medications and may cause sweating, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, loss of consciousness, or seizures."	Type 2 DM is considered a preventable disease, and people with prediabetes can prevent a progression to diabetes by losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising. A combination of daily aerobic exercise and resistance training (twice a week) is very beneficial for maintaining blood sugar control.	"Powers AC. Chapter 344.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hyperthyroidism	Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland malfunctions and produces too much thyroid hormone. This condition is also known as overactive thyroid or thyrotoxicosis. An abnormal enlargement of the thyroid (goiter) develops in certain forms of hyperthyroidism. |  | The thyroid gland is located in the anterior area of the neck and uses iodine atoms to produce two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T4 is produced and then converted to T3, the more active form of thyroid hormone. When these hormones are released in the blood, they affect numerous body functions, including metabolism, body temperature, body weight, heart rate, breathing, nervous system function, and muscle function. When a disorder makes the thyroid produce too much hormone, the body’s metabolism becomes abnormally accelerated. | Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately 1% of the United States population. Most patients respond well to proper treatment although some experience potentially serious complications.	"Normally, an area of the brain called the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) - a substance that regulates and maintains normal levels of thyroid hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are low, the pituitary releases TSH, which stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4. Conversely, when thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary decreases TSH and less T4 is produced. Certain diseases disrupt this system and cause the thyroid to produce excessive levels of T4 on its own. The most common causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves’ disease, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, and thyroiditis. | Graves’ disease. Graves’s disease (or toxic diffuse goiter) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. This disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system produces antibodies that target thyroid cells resulting in excess T4 production. A normal immune system only attacks foreign substances, like germs; however, in Graves’ disease, the immune system erroneously attacks the thyroid. Sometimes the attack includes the area behind the eyes (Graves ophthalmopathy) or the skin on the lower legs (Graves’ dermopathy). Graves’ disease is more common in women than men and it runs in families. The underlying cause of Graves’ disease is unknown.
  Overactive thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules (adenomas) are growths or lumps (usually noncancerous) that occur in 3-7% of the U.S. population. For unknown reasons, some thyroid nodules become overactive and release excess T4. Toxic adenoma is a single noncancerous overactive thyroid nodule. Toxic multinodular goiter refers to multiple overactive nodules.
  Thyroiditis. Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. The etiology of thyroiditis is often unknown. Autoimmune, viral, or drug-induced factors may be involved. Subacute thyroiditis is a particularly painful form of this disorder. Sometimes women develop thyroiditis after pregnancy (postpartum thyroiditis).
  Iodine. Because the thyroid uses iodine to synthesize thyroid hormones, people who consume excess iodine (found in certain medications, dietary supplements, and foods) may develop hyperthyroidism.
  Pituitary adenoma. A noncancerous growth (adenoma) of the pituitary may secrete excess TSH resulting in hyperthyroidism.
  Thyroid medication. Excessive use of thyroid medication, used to treat low thyroid function, elevates the blood level of thyroid hormone above normal."	" | The most common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: | Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)

  Pituitary adenoma. A noncancerous growth (adenoma) of the pituitary may secrete excess TSH resulting in hyperthyroidism.
  Thyroid medication. Excessive use of thyroid medication, used to treat low thyroid function, elevates the blood level of thyroid hormone above normal. | Normally, an area of the brain called the hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland to produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) - a substance that regulates and maintains normal levels of thyroid hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are low, the pituitary releases TSH, which stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4. Conversely, when thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary decreases TSH and less T4 is produced. Certain diseases disrupt this system and cause the thyroid to produce excessive levels of T4 on its own. The most common causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves’ disease, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, and thyroiditis. | Causes and Risk Factors | Hyperthyroidism occurs in approximately 1% of the United States population. Most patients respond well to proper treatment although some experience potentially serious complications. | The thyroid gland is located in the anterior area of the neck and uses iodine atoms to produce two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). T4 is produced and then converted to T3, the more active form of thyroid hormone. When these hormones are released in the blood, they affect numerous body functions, including metabolism, body temperature, body weight, heart rate, breathing, nervous system function, and muscle function. When a disorder makes the thyroid produce too much hormone, the body’s metabolism becomes abnormally accelerated. |  | Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland malfunctions and produces too much thyroid hormone.

Certain diseases disrupt this system and cause the thyroid to produce excessive levels of T4 on its own. The most common causes of hyperthyroidism are Graves’ disease, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, and thyroiditis. | Graves’ disease. Graves’s disease (or toxic diffuse goiter) is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. This disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system produces antibodies that target thyroid cells resulting in excess T4 production. A normal immune system only attacks foreign substances, like germs; however, in Graves’ disease, the immune system erroneously attacks the thyroid. Sometimes the attack includes the area behind the eyes (Graves ophthalmopathy) or the skin on the lower legs (Graves’ dermopathy). Graves’ disease is more common in women than men and it runs in families. The underlying cause of Graves’ disease is unknown.
  Overactive thyroid nodules. Thyroid nodules (adenomas) are growths or lumps (usually noncancerous) that occur in 3-7% of the U.S. population. For unknown reasons, some thyroid nodules become overactive and release excess T4. Toxic adenoma is a single noncancerous overactive thyroid nodule. Toxic multinodular goiter refers to multiple overactive nodules.
  Thyroiditis. Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. The etiology of thyroiditis is often unknown. Autoimmune, viral, or drug-induced factors may be involved. Subacute thyroiditis is a particularly painful form of this disorder. Sometimes women develop thyroiditis after pregnancy (postpartum thyroiditis).
  Iodine. Because the thyroid uses iodine to synthesize thyroid hormones, people who consume excess iodine (found in certain medications, dietary supplements, and foods) may develop hyperthyroidism.
  Pituitary adenoma. A noncancerous growth (adenoma) of the pituitary may secrete excess TSH resulting in hyperthyroidism.
  Thyroid medication. Excessive use of thyroid medication, used to treat low thyroid function, elevates the blood level of thyroid hormone above normal. | Symptoms |  | The most common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: | Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
  Weight loss
  Shortness of breath
  Sweating
  Increased sensitivity to heat
  Nervousness and irritability
  Fatigue
  Muscle weakness
  Enlargement of the thyroid
  Changes in menstrual patterns
  Increased bowel movement frequency
  Skin thinning
  Hair brittleness
  Sleep difficulty. | Complications | Complications that may arise as a consequence of hyperthyroidism include: | Rapid, irregular heart rhythms
  Congestive heart failure (when the heart inadequately pumps blood to the rest of the body)
  Osteoporosis (weak, brittle bones) resulting from excess thyroid hormone’s interference with the bones’ absorption of calcium
  Graves’ ophthalmopathy (eye protrusion, redness, swelling, tearing, sensitivity to light, and dryness)
  Graves dermopathy (redness and swelling of the skin on the lower legs)
  Thyrotoxic crisis, also called thyroid storm (a severe, life-threatening form of hyperthyroidism associated with fever, sweating, severe tachycardia, hypertension, heart failure, delirium, abdominal pain, and coma). | Diagnosis | The symptoms of hyperthyroidism may resemble other disorders, making the disease difficult to diagnose on the basis of symptoms alone. Additionally, symptoms are often diminished or absent in elderly patients. | Patients with hyperthyroidism may display a tremor, overactive reflexes, eye changes, and warm, sweaty skin. An enlarged thyroid is not always present. | Blood tests detect high levels of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 and a low level of TSH. Other blood tests detect the specific anti-thyroid antibody present in patients with Graves’ disease. You can even order a home thyroid test online, which allows you to collect and mail a small sample of your blood for quick lab results (but remember to share these with your healthcare provider afterward). | An ultrasound creates images of the thyroid to check for abnormal growths. A thyroid radioiodine uptake test is a type of scan that helps determine the underlying cause of the disease. | Treatment | Radioactive iodine therapy destroys the thyroid gland over several months. After treatment, the thyroid becomes underactive (hypothyroidism), so patients are then prescribed thyroid hormone replacement medication, such as levothyroxine.
  Anti-thyroid medications (such as propylthiouracil or methimazole) suppress the thyroid’s production of hormones. The course of treatment works gradually and patients often need to continue the medication for a year or more. Following treatment, patients usually need thyroid hormone replacement. Liver damage is a potentially serious adverse effect of anti-thyroid medications.
  Beta blockers are medications that slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. Adverse effects include dizziness and fatigue.
  Thyroidectomy, surgery to remove the thyroid gland, is rarely used to treat hyperthyroidism. Thyroidectomy is reserved for those patients who are not candidates for radioactive iodine or anti-thyroid medication.
  Graves’ ophthalmopathy may be treated with steroid medications that reduce swelling behind the eyes, or surgery to remove a piece of orbital bone and relieve pressure on the eyes. Sometimes, eye muscle surgery is performed to realign the eyeballs and correct double vision. | There are no known methods to prevent naturally occurring forms of hyperthyroidism. However, patients who use thyroid medication should have their thyroid hormone levels checked at least once a year to avoid hyperthyroidism caused by taking too much medication."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/mittelschmerz	Mittelschmerz is a lower abdominal pain that one in five women will experience during ovulation - the monthly process of releasing an egg from the ovaries. The pain is one-sided and occurs in the middle of the cycle, hence the German word mittelschmerz (or “middle pain”). Mittelschmerz is different than menstrual cramping or abdominal discomfort that is linked with other stages of the menstrual cycle. This condition is not considered harmful and generally does not require medical intervention. Over-the-counter pain medication can help alleviate the pain, which can be severe at times.	" | Mittelschmerz occurs about 14 days before the next expected period, which is when an egg is released from a follicle inside the ovary. Although the exact cause of the pain is not known, there are two possible explanations: | Stretching of the ovary due to follicle growth just prior to releasing an egg can cause pain.
  Abdominal irritation may result from blood or fluid released by the ruptured follicle."	"The main symptom of mittelschmerz is a one-sided pain that occurs on the side the egg is released. The pain can last from a few minutes to a few days and can switch sides each month, depending on which ovary releases an egg. Some months, there may be little to no pain. The symptoms of mittelschmerz include: | One-sided abdominal pain
  Pain that lasts from minutes to hours
  Sharp cramps
  Mild vaginal bleeding
  Pain that is severe (rarely)."	Mittelschmerz is generally managed at home and does not require medical intervention. Doctors look for other causes when severe pain persists and other symptoms (e.g., fever, nausea) develop. Conditions other than mittelschmerz that can cause abdominal pain include appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. The most common way of examining the female reproductive system for physical abnormalities is with an abdominal or transvaginal ultrasound, which uses sound waves to produce a picture of internal organs. | The abdominal pain associated with mittelschmerz can be managed at home with the help of over-the-counter pain relief drugs. Mittelschmerz is not associated with any underlying health disorders or serious complications.	There is no way to prevent mittelschmerz, but women can anticipate and plan for the pain symptoms by tracking their ovulation cycle on a calendar. Contraceptive pills that stop ovulation may help lessen the pain from mittelschmerz.	"“Mittelschmerz”. MedlinePlus, NIH.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/pituitary-adenoma	"Pituitary adenomas are benign (noncancerous) tumors of the pituitary gland - a small structure located behind the eyes, beneath the brain. Most pituitary tumors are benign, meaning that they do not spread to distant locations in the body. Cancerous pituitary tumors are extremely rare. | The pituitary gland is a principal part of the endocrine system (the set of glands and organs that produce hormones). The pituitary is called the “master endocrine gland,” because it produces specific hormones that control the activities of other endocrine glands and organs in the body. | Pituitary adenomas usually develop in older adults, but they may occur in children. These tumors are very common, occurring in up to 20% of adults. Although most pituitary adenomas are harmless, some cause serious problems. Typically, a pituitary adenoma develops in the anterior pituitary, and its impact is determined by its size and whether it secretes hormones. | Functional (hormone-producing) pituitary adenomas excessively secrete one or more hormones - prolactin, growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
  Nonfunctional pituitary adenomas do not secrete hormones.
  Macroadenomas are large (>1 centimeter) and may compress adjacent structures, causing serious complications such as loss of vision. Large tumors impair the pituitary’s function, causing hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism).
  Microadenomas are small (<1 centimeter) and rarely compress nearby tissues, but they can be harmful if they secrete excessive hormones. | Prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common type, and they cause hyperprolactinemia.
  Growth hormone-secreting adenomas cause acromegaly in adults or gigantism in children.
  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting adenomas cause Cushing’s disease.
  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-secreting adenomas are rare and lead to hyperthyroidism.
  Gonadotropin (LH and FSH)-secreting adenomas are very rare and cause reproductive dysfunction."	The underlying cause of pituitary adenomas is unknown, and there are no lifestyle or environmental factors that increase a person’s risk of developing this condition. Rare cases are linked to inherited genetic syndromes. | 	"The signs and symptoms of pituitary adenomas correlate with the tumor size and whether excess hormone is secreted. The onset of symptoms is gradual and early symptoms may go unnoticed for years. | Signs and symptoms in females: | Infertility
  Loss of menstrual periods
  Diminished libido
  Abnormal breast milk secretion (galactorrhea). | Signs and symptoms in males: | Low testosterone level (something you can check at home using a testosterone test)
  Infertility
  Impotency
  Breast development. | Signs and symptoms of excess GH in adults (acromegaly): | Enlargement of hands feet, and skull
  Large protruding jaw
  Deep voice
  Large tongue
  High blood sugars
  Increased body hair
  Painful joints
  Excessive sweating
  Thickened skin
  Heart disease
  Kidney stones. | Signs and symptoms of excess GH In children (gigantism): | Abnormally rapid growth
  Very tall stature
  Painful joints
  Excessive sweating. | Excess ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol (Cushing’s disease). Normally, cortisol maintains blood pressure and helps the body react to stressful conditions; however, too much cortisol disrupts numerous bodily functions. | Symptoms of Cushing’s disease: | Weight gain
  Roundness and fullness of the face (moon facies)
  Excess fat on the back of the neck (buffalo hump)
  Purple stretch marks on the abdomen
  High blood sugar
  Hypertension
  Increased body hair growth
  Depression
  Loss of libido
  Menstrual changes
  Osteoporosis. | Excess TSH stimulates the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) and abnormally accelerates the body’s metabolism. | Symptoms of hyperthyroidism: | Rapid heart rate
  Weight loss
  Sweating
  Tremors
  Anxiety
  Enlarged thyroid. | Excess gonadotropins (LH and FSH) disrupt reproductive processes. | Symptoms: | Menstrual period changes
  Low testosterone level in males
  Loss of libido. | Large pituitary adenomas may cause headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Compression of the optic chiasm causes loss of peripheral vision. Injury to the posterior pituitary impairs antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production (a condition known as diabetes insipidus) and leads to excess urination, dehydration, and thirst. Additional pituitary hormone deficiencies cause infertility. | Functional microadenomas are tiny, but they cause problems by secreting excessive hormones. Conversely, small, asymptomatic nonfunctional adenomas (so-called incidentalomas) are usually found on MRIs performed for other reasons."	"Several tests are used to diagnose pituitary tumors. | Visual Field Examination - Compression of the optic chiasm causes a loss of peripheral vision on both sides.
  Hormone Testing - Blood, urine, and saliva are tested for abnormal hormone levels. Hormone levels are also tested in response to certain hormone-suppressant medications.
  Imaging Studies - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary provides detailed pictures of the gland and surrounding structures. Computed tomography (CT) may also be obtained. | Treatment | Surgery is the predominant treatment for pituitary adenomas. Treatment is important for functional or large tumors; however, small, asymptomatic nonfunctional adenomas (incidentalomas) are closely watched and not necessarily treated unless they grow. | Pituitary Surgery: Most pituitary adenomas are removed through the nose (transsphenoidal approach). This approach allows neurosurgeons to remove the tumor without entering the brain. Surgery is usually more successful for small tumors than large ones. Postoperative complications include hormone deficiencies such as low ACTH (secondary adrenal insufficiency) characterized by low cortisol, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, hair loss, and loss of libido. Some patients develop low vasopressin, which causes diabetes insipidus. These complications are treated with hormone replacement medications. Additional complications may include infection of the linings of the brain (meningitis), or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the nose.
  Medications: Sometimes medications are prescribed in lieu of surgery or for treatment of complications after surgery. Medications are available to block the production of excess hormones or correct hormone deficiencies.
  Radiation Therapy: Radiation is used to destroy the tumor when surgery alone is inadequate or when a patient is a poor candidate for surgery. External radiation treatments are administered over a period of weeks. Another method, called Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery, uses a focused beam of radiation directly precisely at the pituitary tumor. Radiation therapy does not provide immediate results and patients may take years to achieve the full effect."	Pituitary adenomas are not associated with any known lifestyle or environmental risk factors, so there are no available methods to prevent the condition. People with a family history of pituitary tumors associated with inherited genetic syndromes should be regularly monitored for early signs of the disorder.	"Melmed S, Kleinberg D. Chapter 9.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/pms	It’s normal for girls and women to experience some physical and mood changes related to the menstrual cycle. Typically, these show up one to two weeks before a period and disappear one to two days after bleeding begins. When these changes occur regularly and are intense enough to interfere with daily activities, they’re called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). | The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates that 85 percent of women have at least one PMS symptom, and about 3-8 percent have a severe form of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). | PMS can begin anytime after a girl’s first menstrual period (known as menarche). The condition is most common in women with children, those with a family history of depression, and those who have been diagnosed with a mood disorder. PMS symptoms cease temporarily during pregnancy and permanently after menopause.	" | Though it is not completely clear what causes PMS, researchers suspect the condition is linked to natural hormonal fluctuations. Following ovulation (when an ovary releases an egg), ovaries produce a considerable amount of progesterone. Specifically, the progesterone comes from the remains of the ovarian follicle that released the egg; this follicle’s remains are known as the corpus luteum at this stage in the menstrual cycle. Estrogen production also increases several days after ovulation. Together, the estrogen and progesterone act to thicken and prepare the inner wall of the uterus (endometrium) for pregnancy. | An egg only lives unfertilized for roughly a day. When fertilization and implantation do not occur (usually a fertilized egg will take a handful of days to travel down the fallopian tube to the uterus), ovaries significantly slow the production of progesterone and estrogen. This drop results in the uterus shedding its extra layering and expelling both that and the deceased egg from the body in the event called menstruation. Some women may be more sensitive than others to this reduction in progesterone and estrogen toward the end of their menstrual cycle. | Other possible factors that contribute to PMS include: | Fluctuations in levels of the brain chemical serotonin
  Alcohol and caffeine intake
  A diet high in sodium, which promotes water retention and bloating
  Certain vitamin and mineral deficiencies | Stress and emotional issues don’t cause PMS, but they may make symptoms worse. In fact, about half of all women who seek medical care for PMS also have a depressive disorder or anxiety disorder."	"The symptoms, timing and severity of PMS vary greatly among women, and even in the same woman from month to month. | Common emotional symptoms include: | Mood changes (depression, sadness, irritability)
  Feeling tense or anxious
  Crying spells
  Sleeping too little or too much
  Social withdrawal
  Increased appetite or food cravings
  Decreased memory and concentration
  Changes in sexual desire | Common physical symptoms of PMS include: | Aches and pains (especially in the head, back, joints and muscles)
  Breast swelling or tenderness
  Stomach upsets
  Bloating and water weight gain
  Diarrhea and constipation
  Acne flare-ups
  Tiredness, feeling sluggish"	"PMS is usually diagnosed based on personal history. Some physicians ask patients to track their symptoms across several menstrual cycles so that patterns can be pinpointed. | The physician may also order tests to rule out conditions that share symptoms with PMS, including anxiety disorders, depression, hypothyroidism, menopause and irritable bowel syndrome. | PMS is usually only treated if symptoms are distressing or interfering with a woman’s daily activities. Common therapies include: | Over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin to help relieve aches and pains.
  Oral contraceptives (birth control pills), which decrease or eliminate symptoms in some women.
  Diuretic medications to reduce bloating (usually in conjunction with a low-salt diet).
  Supplements of folic acid, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, vitamin B-6 and vitamin E to relieve nutritional deficiencies that worsen symptoms. (You can check for vitamin D deficiency using a vitamin D home test.)
  Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication to regulate severe mood symptoms. | Some women report that herbal remedies like black cohosh, chasteberry, evening primrose oil and natural progesterone creams help them feel better around the time of their period. Check with your doctor before trying these, especially if you also take prescription medications. | The preventative strategies listed in the section below may also help to control existing PMS symptoms. | With treatment and lifestyle modification, the outlook for alleviating PMS symptoms is very good. While symptoms may not go away completely, most women find they can continue with their daily activities."	"Not all PMS symptoms are preventable, but the following lifestyle changes may help: | Engage in 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on most days of the week, plus strength training on at least two days.
  Eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, all of which are rich in complex carbohydrates.
  Limit your intake of salt, alcohol and caffeine, especially in the second half of the menstrual cycle.
  Eat smaller meals more frequently to help prevent bloating and keep blood sugar levels stable.
  Take a multivitamin to prevent deficiencies.
  Get adequate sleep.
  Find healthy ways to manage stress, like breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, massage or progressive muscle relaxation."	"“Premenstrual syndrome.” MedlinePlus Encyclopedia, 2012. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001505.htm. Accessed April 14, 2014.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome	Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is a common type of hormonal imbalance that causes a variety of health problems in women. The condition is named for the multiple cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that form on the ovaries of most patients. PCOS is one of the leading causes of infertility among American women and is associated with menstrual difficulties, chronic health conditions and unwanted changes in appearance. |  | Under normal circumstances, human eggs develop in female reproductive organs called the ovaries. The ovaries also produce the sex hormones estrogen, progesterone and androgen, which regulate the menstrual cycle and reproductive process. | During a normal menstrual cycle, an egg grows in a fluid-filled pocket on the ovary surface called a follicle. When the egg matures, the follicle ruptures and releases it into the fallopian tube connected to the uterus. This process is known as ovulation. | In women with PCOS, ovulation is irregular or suppressed altogether due to a hormonal imbalance. In these cases, growing egg may not mature fully or erupt from the follicle. Without ovulation, the woman does not menstruate (have a monthly period), and the ovary does not produce the female sex hormone progesterone. The partially formed follicles may develop into fluid filled cysts on the ovary surface. | In addition to decreased fertility and irregular periods, the hormonal imbalances of PCOS can cause other problems. About 70 percent of patients experience hormonal symptoms such as male pattern baldness or excess hair growth on the face and body (hirsutism). About 80 percent of women with PCOS are obese. Having PCOS also elevates a woman’s risk of cardiovascular disease. | PCOS is quite common, affecting 5 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age (or about 5 million in the United States). Girls who begin puberty before age eight may be at increased risk for developing PCOS later on. While menstrual symptoms disappear at menopause, appearance issues and chronic illness risk usually persist across the life span.	"The direct cause of PCOS is a hormonal imbalance - specifically, an excess of hormones called androgens. These hormones are more plentiful in men’s bodies than in women’s and are responsible for secondary sex characteristics like facial hair, fat distribution and pattern baldness. | It’s unknown why some women seem to produce more androgens than others, but experts believe the following interrelated factors may play a role: | Genetics. PCOS appears to run in families.
  Insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps the body’s cells convert blood sugar (glucose) into energy. When the body has trouble using insulin, the pancreas secretes more of it into the blood. It is theorized that excess insulin stimulates androgen production.
  Low-grade inflammation. Immune response caused by food intolerances is linked to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. Studies show that women with PCOS are prone to this type of inflammation.
  Exposure to excess androgens during fetal development. Some studies suggest that fetal androgen exposure may promote the development of abdominal fat in women, a pattern that is linked to both insulin resistance and low-grade inflammation."	"A diagnosis of PCOS requires the presence of symptoms in at least two of the following clusters: | Menstrual problems. These can include excessively heavy or light periods, infrequent periods, a long menstrual cycle (35 days or more) or periods that stop for four months or longer.
  High androgen levels. These can be measured directly by a blood test. Symptoms like thinning hair, pattern baldness, hirsutism (excess face and body hair) and adult acne can also indicate excess androgen.
  Multiple small ovarian cysts. These develop in most (but not all) women with PCOS. | Other signs include: | Difficulty getting pregnant (female infertility)
  Dandruff
  Obesity or weight gain (especially around the waist area)
  Thick, discolored skin patches
  Skin tags
  Pain in the pelvic area (may resemble menstrual cramping)
  Anxiety or depression
  Sleep apnea."	"At present, no specific test exists that can diagnose PCOS. When a woman presents with PCOS symptoms, her doctor may use the following assessments to make a diagnosis: | Medical history and physical exam to check for irregular periods, weight issues, hair growth and other symptoms.
  Pelvic exam to check the reproductive organs by sight and touch.
  Blood tests to measure sugar, cholesterol and androgen levels.
  Vaginal ultrasound, a test that uses reflected sound waves to create pictures of the pelvic organs.
  Tests as needed to rule out other conditions. | To date, there is no cure for PCOS. Treatment focuses on managing each woman’s symptoms according to her needs and preferences and may include: | Birth control pills (combination or progesterone type) to help to restore normal hormone balance and relieve some symptoms.
  Anti-androgen medications to help relieve appearance-related symptoms like hair loss and hirsutism.
  Metformin (Glucophage®), a drug used to treat diabetes that has been shown to stimulate ovulation in some women.
  Fertility drugs to stimulate ovulation in women who wish to become pregnant.
  Weight loss and healthy diet to reduce insulin resistance, which in turn helps to restore healthy hormone balance and ovulation.
  Ovarian drilling surgery. In this procedure, the surgeon passes a laparoscope (a tube with a camera in the end) through a small incision in the abdomen and uses an electric needle or laser to burn holes in the follicles on the ovaries’ surfaces. In some women, this lowers androgen levels, allowing more regular ovulation for the next few months. | Because PCOS can lead to serious complications, it’s important to start treatment as soon as possible. Having untreated PCOS increases a woman’s risk of: | Diabetes (more than half of women with PCOS develop type 2 diabetes or prediabetes by age 40)
  Heart attack
  High blood pressure
  High cholesterol
  Sleep apnea (a breathing problem during sleep)
  Endometrial cancer
  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (inflammation of the liver caused by accumulation of fats)
  Anxiety and depression
  Miscarriage
  Pregnancy complications | Women with PCOS can reduce their risk of complications by maintaining a healthy weight and getting tested regularly for diabetes."	It’s unclear whether PCOS is preventable. In some cases, the condition appears to develop in response to substantial weight gain. Healthy diet and regular activity can help to keep weight stable and decrease insulin resistance.	"“Polycystic ovary syndrome.” Larissa Hirsch.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/prostatitis	"Prostatitis is an infection or inflammation of the prostate gland, a walnut-sized gland located just under the bladder in men. Its job is to produce prostatic fluid, which, as a major component of semen, serves to nourish and transport sperm. When the prostate is swollen or enlarged, its lobes can compress the urethra, causing problems with urination and sexual function. | Prostatitis is quite common, affecting five to nine percent of men in their lifetimes. It occurs in men of all ages, but is most common in young and middle-aged men. | Prostatitis occurs in four types: | Acute bacterial prostatitis, caused by an infection, is least common but easiest to diagnose and treat. Symptoms come on strong and suddenly. This type of prostatitis can be quite serious if the infection spreads to the blood or other parts of the body.
  Chronic bacterial prostatitis develops more gradually, and symptoms are usually less severe than in the acute form. The condition may be long-lasting or may recur after treatment.
  Chronic abacterial prostatitis, or chronic pelvic pain syndrome, is prostatitis without a clear cause and, actually, the most common type. Symptoms may be constant or occur as occasional flare-ups. Sometimes tests will detect infection-fighting cells in the urine or semen, but no bacteria can be found.
  Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis is diagnosed when infection-fighting cells are present in prostate tissue, urine or semen but no symptoms are present. This type is sometimes discovered by accident when patients are treated for another problem."	 | Bacterial prostatitis usually occurs when urine infected with bacteria flows backward through the ducts connecting the urethra and prostate gland. This is most common during or just after a urinary tract infection. Trauma to the pelvic area due to medical procedures or activities like cycling can increase the risk of bacterial infection. | Bacterial prostatitis can become chronic if antibiotics fail to kill all the bacteria in the prostate. Sometimes medicines can’t penetrate deeply enough into the prostate tissue to reach all the bacteria. Some types of bacteria are also more resistant to antibiotics than others. | The medical community is not sure exactly what causes abacterial prostatitis. In many cases, it seems to be due to an infection that tests can’t detect. Other possible causes include pelvic muscle spasms due to a nervous system disorder or persistent immune reaction to an injury or previous infection.	"Symptoms of prostatitis are nonspecific, meaning they’re shared by many other diseases, including serious ones like prostate cancer. For this reason, it is important to seek medical help promptly. | Common symptoms include: | Pain or burning during urination
  Difficult urinating (a dribbling or hesitant urine stream, or inability to empty the bladder)
  Frequent urination, especially at night
  Urgency (the need to urinate quickly)
  Pain in the abdomen, pelvic area, low back or perineum (between the scrotum and the rectum)
  Pain or unusual sensations in the penis and testicles
  Painful orgasm and ejaculation
  Impotence or decreased libido | In addition, bacterial prostatitis may cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and muscle aches."	" | Some types of prostatitis are difficult to diagnose. For this reason, men may benefit from consulting a urologist, a doctor who specializes in urinary and male reproductive health. | Common diagnostics include: | Digital rectal exam. The physician inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate for swelling, tenderness or lumps. The physician may also probe pelvic muscles and ligaments for pain and discomfort.
  Urinalysis, which detects bacteria, white blood cells and other signs of infection in the urine. In some cases, the physician massages the prostate gland with a finger (as in the digital rectal exam) to stimulate the release of prostate fluid before the urine sample is collected.
  Urine culture. Urine is placed in a medium that encourages bacterial growth.
  Blood culture, used to see whether bacterial prostatitis has spread to the blood.
  Urodynamic tests, which provide a clearer picture of bladder functioning and mechanics.
  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, a blood test that measures levels of a certain protein released by the prostate. This test is usually performed when the man is also at risk for prostate cancer. | Abacterial prostatitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes must be ruled out. To do so, the doctor may order additional tests such as MRI, cystoscopy, ultrasound and biopsy. | Treatment | Acute bacterial prostatitis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Usually oral antibiotics suffice, but intravenous antibiotics may be necessary in severe cases. Therapy lasts two to four weeks. | Chronic bacterial prostatitis is treated with a longer course of antibiotics, typically eight to 12 weeks. For men with recurring infections, the doctor may prescribe low-dose antibiotic therapy for up to six months. | Antibiotics are sometimes effective even when tests show no signs of bacteria. For this reason, they are also often prescribed as the first line of treatment for chronic abacterial prostatitis. | Most acute bacterial prostatitis cases and about 75 percent of chronic bacterial prostatitis cases clear up completely with antibiotic therapy. | When prostatitis can’t be cured with antibiotics, the goal of treatment shifts to symptom management. Most men continue their normal activities with treatment and a few accommodations. | Urinary symptoms can be relieved by a class of medications called alpha blockers that help to relax the muscles around the bladder and prostate.
  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen help to relieve pain and fever associated with prostatitis. They may be purchased over the counter or prescribed by a physician depending on the strength needed.
  Regular prostate massage performed by a physician may help drain prostate fluid from the inflamed ducts and relieve pressure.
  At home, patients can try soaking in a warm sitz bath to relieve symptoms. Some men find it more comfortable to sit on a pillow or inflatable cushion. Avoid alcohol, caffeine and acidic and spicy substances that tend to irritate the bladder."	"It is unknown whether prostatitis can be prevented, but the following tips may help to reduce your risk: | Seek medical attention promptly if you have symptoms or prostatitis or a urinary tract infection.
  Wear appropriate protective gear when playing sports to prevent trauma to the pelvic area.
  For cyclists, invest in a well-engineered seat that minimizes pressure on the prostate.
  Drink plenty of water and stay hydrated. Limit your intake of caffeine and alcohol and spicy or acidic substances that can irritate the bladder.
  If your doctor prescribes antibiotics for prostatitis, take them as directed. Avoid skipping doses or stopping early, even if you feel better."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hashimotos-disease	Hashimoto’s disease is a condition that causes inflammation and destruction of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis). Hashimoto’s disease is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder is an example of an autoimmune disease, a type of disease in which the body’s immune system malfunctions and attacks itself. In Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system behaves abnormally and mounts an attack on the thyroid gland. |  | The thyroid gland is positioned in the anterior aspect of the neck and normally produces two hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones directly regulate or influence metabolism, body weight, heart rate, body temperature, breathing, nervous system functions, and muscle activity. | In Hashimoto’s disease, damage to the thyroid gland decreases thyroid hormone production. Often the diseased thyroid gland underperforms to such an extent that bodily functions are impaired, causing a disorder called hypothyroidism. Additionally, many individuals with severe thyroid gland inflammation develop a visible thyroid enlargement in the neck, termed a goiter. | Hashimoto’s disease is the most common type of thyroiditis. This condition occurs much more frequently in women than men and typically develops in people age 30 to 50.	"Normally the immune system makes proteins (antibodies) that protect the body against foreign invaders like viruses, bacteria, and cancers. In autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto’s disease, the immune system malfunctions and produces antibodies that mistakenly attack healthy tissues instead of protecting them. The exact trigger, causing the immune system to go awry, is unknown. | Risk factors for Hashimoto’s disease include the following: | Family history of thyroid disease
  Having other autoimmune diseases (such as type 1 diabetes, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis)
  Excess consumption of iodine
  Exposure to certain chemicals
  Certain medications
  Viral infections."	"The symptoms of Hashimoto’s disease are primarily those of hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter) with pressure on adjacent structures in the neck. Hashimoto’s disease typically progresses very slowly, and often the symptoms are subtle or easily confused with other conditions. Some individuals with Hashimoto’s disease never develop hypothyroidism or goiter and experience no symptoms at all. |  | Symptoms associated with hypothyroidism are as follows: | Fatigue
  Sleepiness
  Weight gain
  Depression
  Cold intolerance
  Dry skin
  Dry hair
  Puffy face
  Hoarseness
  Leg swelling
  Muscle aches
  Heavy or irregular menstrual periods
  Low heart rate
  Constipation
  Decreased concentration. | Severe untreated hypothyroidism leads to myxedema, a condition characterized by the following: | Heart failure
  Seizures
  Loss of consciousness
  Death. | Symptoms associated with goiter include: | Painless swelling of the thyroid gland in the front of the neck
  Difficulty breathing
  Difficulty swallowing."	"An individual’s history and physical examination provide the initial basis for a diagnosis of thyroid disease. When a physician suspects hypothyroidism, specific blood tests confirm the diagnosis and identify the underlying disease. | Thyroid-stimulating hormone level. When thyroid hormone levels are low, an area of the brain called the pituitary gland releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a substance that stimulates the thyroid to produce more T4. An elevated TSH level is an early indicator of hypothyroidism.
  Free T4. Free T4 is the amount of thyroid hormone available in the blood that body tissues use to support their activities. A low free T4 level is evidence of hypothyroidism. | Anti-thyroid antibodies distinguish Hashimoto’s disease from other causes of hypothyroidism. Hashimoto’s disease is identified by the presence of elevated levels of anti-thyroid antibodies not found in other forms of thyroid disease. | Ultrasound imaging studies and computed tomography scans provide detailed pictures of the body. Physicians may use these studies to identify abnormal growths of the thyroid gland. | Hypothyroidism is treated with a man-made thyroid hormone replacement medication called levothyroxine (Synthroid or Levoxyl). Although this medication does not reverse the thyroid gland damage, it effectively restores the bodily functions impacted by hypothyroidism. Physicians monitor TSH levels to determine the proper medication dosage for each individual. | Since the underlying problem is not cured, people with Hashimoto’s disease and hypothyroidism require life-long treatment with thyroid hormone replacement."	Although there is no known way to prevent Hashimoto’s disease, the condition is highly treatable. Early treatment is recommended to avoid life-threatening problems associated with severe hypothyroidism.	"Hashimoto’s Disease.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids	The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that infects humans and can lead to an advanced disease state called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There are two types of the HIV virus: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and the dominant strain seen globally. | HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids (e.g. semen, blood and breast milk) via activities like sexual intercourse, needle injection and breastfeeding. What makes this virus unique is its ability to evade the body’s natural defense system by hiding in immune cells called CD4+ T cells. In fact, HIV effectively hijacks these immune cells and uses them to replicate before destroying them. | AIDS occurs in the final stage of HIV infection, when so many immune cells are destroyed that the immune system can no longer fight disease. Although HIV and AIDS are often used interchangeably, it is important to know they refer to the virus and the late-stage disease, respectively. | The earliest case of HIV in the United States dates back to mid- to late 1970s. According the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), over 1.2 million people in the United States are currently living with HIV, with 50,000 new infections expected each year. In the United States, men who have sex with men have the highest risk of contracting HIV. | Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that roughly 35 million people are living with HIV/AIDS; of them, approximately 3.2 million are children under the age of 15. HIV/AIDS continues to be a global health problem with low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected. | Without treatment, the life expectancy of an HIV-infected individual is 9-11 years. Following an AIDS diagnosis, that life expectancy is reduced to less than 2 years. The cause of death is generally due to complications from certain cancers (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma and lymphomas) and opportunistic infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and cryptosporidiosis) that arise because of the body’s failing immune system. | There is no cure for HIV, but with proper treatment called “antiretroviral therapy” (ART), it is possible to maintain a low viral count and live a nearly normal life expectancy of up to 50 years. The best way to prevent HIV/AIDS is by avoiding high-risk activities associated with disease transmission, such as unsafe sexual intercourse and needle sharing. | 	"HIV originated from a variant strain that infected non-human primates in Africa.  It is believed that contact with blood from an infected monkey transmitted the virus to humans, where it mutated to HIV. HIV is a retrovirus; its genomic content is stored in the form of RNA that is reverse transcribed into DNA once in the host cell. The primary targets of HIV are human immune cells, such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. | HIV is transmitted between individuals via bodily fluids, and primarily through sexual contact. The virus can transmit when infected bodily fluids (blood, semen, seminal fluid, rectal fluids and vaginal fluids) from one person make contact with broken tissue or the mucus membrane on another person. HIV-infected pregnant women can pass on the virus to their infant during childbirth, or through breast milk. HIV is not spread by air/water, tear/saliva/sweat, hand-shaking or cohabitation with an infected individual. Activities that allow contact with another person’s bodily fluids and increase the chances of contracting HIV include: | Sexual activity.  Unprotected anal, vaginal and oral sex with an infected partner allows HIV to pass from the blood, vaginal/rectal fluids or semen through sores or open skin. This risk is higher for those who have unprotected sex with multiple partners.
  Needle sharing. Sharing needles and other devices used for intravenous drug delivery carries a high risk for transmitting HIV. Traces of blood in the syringe or device from one user can pass to other users.
  Occupational hazards. Nurses, doctors and scientists who have frequent contact with human bodily fluids are considered high-risk. For example, an accidental needle prick while treating an infected patient can transmit HIV to the caregiver.
  Mother-to-infant contact. Expectant mothers with HIV can infect their child during childbirth or afterwards through breast milk. Routine prenatal screening and timely therapy can significantly lower this risk.
  Blood transfusions. Although blood banks screen donated blood for HIV and other diseases, there is a small risk of acquiring HIV during a blood transfusion.
  Other STIs. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) often leave open sores in or around the mouth or genital areas. Anyone with an STI is more likely to have open sores, making them more susceptible to other infections like HIV.
  Race. In the United States, African Americans are most affected by HIV/AIDS and considered a high-risk group. This increased burden is due to insufficient awareness, socioeconomic factors, and stigma about HIV testing.
  Age/gender. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men - especially within the younger African American community - have the greatest risk of contracting HIV in the United States. | AIDS is caused by the gradual destruction of the immune system (CD4+ T cells) by HIV. The rate at which AIDS develops varies per person, but can happen faster without antiretroviral treatment. Without protection from the immune system, the body becomes a target for secondary infections, some cancers and other complications including kidney disease, neurological disorders and wasting syndrome."	"Sometimes infection with HIV does not produce symptoms until the disease has progressed to AIDS; this could take 10 years for some people. Symptoms vary highly from one person to the next and depend on the stage of infection. | Early stage infection typically produces flu-like symptoms that appear within 2-4 weeks of infection. The body’s viral load (number of virus particles) is especially high at this stage, and therefore HIV testing for at-risk individuals is strongly recommended. Buying an STD home test even allows you to test from the convenience of home without waiting for anything but the speedy, discreet delivery of the kit. | Symptoms for early stage infection include: | Fever
  Headaches
  Muscle pain and fatigue
  Sore throat
  Swollen glands
  Rash. | During the clinical latency stage the virus “hides” in the immune cells and is minimally active. Although symptoms tend to disappear and viral load is low during latency, it is still possible to transmit HIV. The latency stage may last up to ten years without treatment, or for many decades with treatment. | Once the infection progresses to AIDS, symptoms for secondary infections or other complications appear. These include: | Significant weight loss
  Fever and night sweats
  Extreme fatigue
  Chronic diarrhea
  Sores in the mouth or genital areas
  Swelling of the lymph glands
  Pneumonia
  Red/brown/purple blotches on the skin
  Neurological disorders (e.g. depression and memory loss)."	"HIV is routinely diagnosed by testing for HIV antibodies in blood or saliva. It may take 3-6 months for HIV antibodies to accumulate to detectable amounts, which is why it is critical to use protection during sex. Following a positive diagnosis, tests for CD4+ T cell count, viral load and drug resistance are performed to determine the optimal treatment regimen. Additional tests may be required to address secondary infections or complications, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, other STIs and kidney damage. | There is no cure for HIV, so the goals of therapy are to prevent viral replication, keep the immune system functioning, and minimize adverse reactions. The timing and method of treatment is decided based on the patient’s test results (CD4 count, viral load and drug resistance) and other existing conditions. It is generally recommended to begin treatment as early as possible in order to maintain a low viral count and prevent progression to AIDS. A typical treatment consists of a drug cocktail with at least three pills (representing different classes of antiviral drugs) taken daily, for life. With antiretroviral treatment, viral numbers drop to undetectable levels, but the body still carries and can transmit the virus. | HIV drugs include: | Reverse transcriptase inhibitors. HIV uses its own reverse transcriptase enzyme to synthesize DNA from RNA. The function of this enzyme is required for viral replication in the host cell. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) directly inhibit the activity of this enzyme. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are faulty mimics of the building blocks used by the enzyme to synthesize DNA.
  Protease inhibitors. HIV protease is another enzyme that is essential to the viral life cycle. Protease inhibitors are molecules that block the activity of this enzyme.
  Integrase inhibitors. The integrase enzyme allows HIV to insert its genetic material into its host cells. Molecules that inhibit HIV integrase block this essential step.
  Entry/fusion inhibitors. These drugs prevent the virus from attaching to and entering CD4+ T cells. | "	"The most effective way to prevent HIV infection/transmission is by avoiding activities that allow exchange of bodily fluids with others. Anyone suspecting an infection should be tested for HIV. Following a positive HIV diagnosis, it is vital to contact existing and previous sexual partners who might have become infected. | Safe sex. Using a new, un-compromised condom during sex prevents the transmission of virus through open sores or open skin.
  Occupational safety. Medical care providers and scientists who frequently treat patients or handle patient samples must use personal protection equipment and follow safety guidelines set by their respective institutions.
  Needle exchange programs.  These programs provide sterile needles to those who inject drugs.
  Prophylactics. This preventative option is available to at-risk groups who are not already infected with HIV. The combination drug Truvada was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for preventing HIV infection; Truvada is also used to treat HIV.
  Prenatal care. Pregnant women who have HIV must receive timely treatment in order to prevent infecting their baby.
  Circumcision. There is some evidence suggesting that male circumcision lowers the risk of acquiring HIV in men."	"“HIV 101”. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Retrieved Dec 16, 2014. http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/crest-syndrome	"Limited scleroderma (also known as CREST syndrome) is a type of scleroderma, which as the name implies is characterized by thick, hardened skin. In the more severe form, this connective tissue disorder can affect the function of internal organs (e.g., esophagus, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, muscle and joints) and even become life threatening. Limited scleroderma is milder form of the disease and affects roughly 50% of scleroderma patients. It is often referred to as CREST syndrome, with each letter representing one of five common features (see Symptoms) of the illness: | Calcinosis
  Raynaud phenomenon (also called Raynaud’s phenomenon or Raynaud’s disease)
  Esophageal dysfunction
  Sclerodactyly
  Telangiectasia |  | The skin hardening associated with limited scleroderma is typically confined to the fingers, hands, lower arms, legs and face. Unlike its more severe form, progression is more gradual and complications involving internal organs are less common. Limited scleroderma can affect the digestive tract, causing difficulty swallowing and frequent heartburn. It can also affect the blood vessels, heart and lungs, leading to hypertension and shortness of breath. There is no cure for scleroderma; treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms."	"The exact cause of limited scleroderma is not known. Scleroderma is believed to be an autoimmune disease, where the body launches an attack against its own organs. In this case, the immune response seems to prompt the body to overproduce collagen, which is deposited in the skin and other organs, altering their function. The risk factors for limited scleroderma are: | Gender: Women are four times more likely to develop limited scleroderma.
  Age: Limited scleroderma is more common in adults and typically starts between the age of 22 and 55.
  Race: African Americans are at higher risk of developing limited scleroderma in the United States.
  Genetics: A family history of autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Hashimoto’s disease, is tied to an increased risk of limited scleroderma.
  Toxins: Exposure to certain toxins (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, benzene, silica and trichloroethylene) may trigger limited scleroderma in some people."	"The symptoms of limited scleroderma develop gradually over several years and include: | Hardened skin (sclerodactyly - the “S” in CREST syndrome): The skin of the fingers, hands, lower arms, legs and face becomes tight, hardened and shiny in appearance. The change in skin condition may limit motion and movement of the fingers and mouth.
  Raynaud’s phenomenon (the “R” in CREST syndrome): A condition of poor blood circulation that causes the toes and fingertips to turn white, and then blue and numb. When circulation returns to normal, the affected skin looks red and may tingle. Raynaud’s phenomenon is an early symptom of limited scleroderma, but it can also occur independent of scleroderma.
  Red skin marks (telangiectasia - the “T” in CREST syndrome): The swelling of small blood vessels near the skin surface creates small red spots or lines on the hands and face.
  Skin bumps (calcinosis - the “C” in CREST syndrome): Calcium deposits under the skin can cause small raised areas on the elbows, knees and fingers. These bumps can be painful or get infected.
  Difficulty swallowing (esophageal dysfunction - the “E” in CREST syndrome): limited scleroderma patients often have challenges swallowing due to poorly functioning muscles in the esophagus. This can also result in a backup of acidic stomach fluids (heartburn), which can damage the esophagus lining."	"Limited scleroderma is hard to diagnose due to a wide range of symptoms that overlap with other diseases. Doctors typically review the patient’s medical and family history, and examine the affected skin and organs. Skin biopsy and blood tests may be performed to assist in the diagnosis. Additional tests may be required to assess the state of internal organs, like the heart and lungs. | There is no cure for limited scleroderma. The following treatments are used to manage the symptoms and avoid complications: | Medication: Infected ulcers on the skin are treated with topical or systemic antibiotics. Patients experiencing heartburn can reduce stomach acids with antacids. Raynaud’s symptoms can be managed with blood pressure-lowering drugs that enhance blood circulation. Drugs that suppress the immune system can help prevent some of the complications associated with the lungs.
  Therapy: Physical therapy helps patients maintain mobility and function with their fingers and face, while occupational therapy teaches patients new ways of performing daily tasks.
  Surgery: large and painful calcium deposits can be removed surgically. Laser surgery helps lessen the appearance of red lines and spots on the face and hands. Skin ulcers on the fingers that become gangrenous may necessitate amputation of the fingertip(s)."	There is no way to prevent limited scleroderma. Those with a high risk of developing the disease can practice vigilance for the known symptoms.	"“Limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome)”. Mayo Clinic.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/lupus	"Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus) is a chronic disease of the immune system that causes inflammation throughout the body. Normally the immune system makes proteins called antibodies that protect the body against foreign invaders like viruses, bacteria, and cancers. In lupus, the immune system malfunctions and produces antibodies that mistakenly attack healthy tissues. Lupus most commonly affects the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, brain, lungs, and blood cells. Lupus belongs to a group of disorders called autoimmune diseases, which attack various parts of the body in a similar fashion. | Discoid lupus is primarily limited to the skin.
  Systemic lupus involves skin, joints, and internal organs.
  Drug-induced lupus is triggered by certain medications. This condition completely resolves when the medication is discontinued. | Lupus occurs far more frequently in women than men and usually occurs in people between age 15 and 40."	"The underlying cause of lupus is unknown, but genetics, hormones, and environmental factors are key elements. Certain genes predispose people to develop lupus by increasing their susceptibility to triggers in the environment. People with lupus often have a close relative with lupus or another autoimmune disease. Additionally, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians are at increased risk for the disorder. | In women, the hormone estrogen is a very important causal factor. Nine times more women develop lupus than men. | Environmental factors associated with lupus include the following: | Medications
  Toxic substances, such as cigarette smoke, mercury, and silica
  Exposure to sunlight
  Infections."	" | Lupus is a lifelong disease characterized by periods of exacerbation (flares), alternating with mild illness or absence of symptoms (remission). Symptoms of lupus are highly variable, so some individuals experience mild symptoms while others develop serious illness. | The following are the most common signs and symptoms of lupus: | Extreme fatigue
  Joint pain and swelling, especially of knees, hands and wrists
  Fever
  Muscle pain
  Swelling (edema) of feet, hands, or eyes
  Skin rashes
  Butterfly-shaped red rash on cheeks
  Headaches
  Rash that develops after exposure to sunlight (photosensitivity)
  Low red blood cell count (anemia)
  Hair loss
  Kidney disease
  Shortness of breath or chest pain with breathing, caused by inflammation of the lining of the lung (pleurisy)
  Chest pain due to inflammation of tissue around the heart (pericarditis)
  Nervous system disease and brain involvement, such as seizure or stroke
  Sores (ulcers) in the nose or mouth
  Blood clotting, which may result in strokes or heart attacks
  Decreased circulation in fingers and toes in response to cold (Raynaud’s phenomenon)."	"The symptoms associated with lupus are often difficult to distinguish from other diseases. Many patients experience mild or vague symptoms, making these cases particularly difficult to diagnosis. | When the symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of lupus, blood tests are used to measure specific types of antibodies, which are elevated in people with lupus. | Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test measures the level of antibodies produced by the immune system and is elevated in autoimmune diseases such as lupus.
  Antiphospholipid antibody test measures another type of antibody that is often elevated in people with lupus.
  Red blood cell count is often low (anemia).
  Kidney function is evaluated with blood and urine tests.
  Kidney biopsy may be required to determine the extent of any kidney disease. In this procedure a sample of kidney tissue is removed and examined under a microscope.
  Skin biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis of discoid lupus. | Treatment | Lupus is a life-long condition and there is no cure. However, there are effective treatments to control symptoms, and most people with lupus live a normal active life. Rarely, lupus involves multiple organs, causing life-threatening illness that requires aggressive treatment. | Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that decreases inflammation.
  Prednisone is a steroid - a potent drug that reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system.
  Immune suppressing agents, such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, are powerful drugs that block activities in the immune system.
  Antimalarial drugs, like hydroxychloroquine, decrease antibody production.
  Anticoagulant medications prevent blood clot formation.
  Sunscreen blocks exposure to ultraviolet light."	There are no known methods to prevent the occurrence of lupus. However, in individuals with the disease, certain measures help decrease the incidence of lupus flares. In some cases, the skin rashes are prevented by avoidance of excessive exposure to sunlight and the use of sunscreen. Healthy lifestyle habits - proper nutrition, avoidance of stress, and not smoking - help prevent severe illness.	"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus).

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis	Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can affect any bodily organ. It is characterized by the growth of tiny inflammatory cells called granulomas or nodules. The most commonly affected body parts are the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes, and skin. However, sarcoidosis can also affect the liver, salivary glands, kidneys, sinuses, heart, muscles and bones, and nervous system. Sarcoidosis may result from the body’s immune system reacting to an unknown substance, such as something inhaled from the air. |  | While there is currently no cure for sarcoidosis, most affected people only need little to modest treatment. Sarcoidosis often clears up on its own. However, some cases can persist for years and cause organ damage. This is because sarcoidosis causes a heightened immune response, which can damage the body’s own tissues. When granulomas over-accumulate in an organ, they can interfere with the normal organ function.	"The exact cause of sarcoidosis remains unknown. It can affect people of any race, age, or gender. However, it typically manifests in adults aged 20-40 years. Certain ethnic groups can develop sarcoidosis more frequently. | African Americans are three to four times more likely to develop sarcoidosis than people of European descent.
  Women tend to be more at risk than men for developing sarcoidosis.
  Whereas African Americans are more prone to developing sarcoidosis in the eyes, the disease can develop as painful skin lumps in Northern Europeans, and tends to affect Japanese people in the eyes and heart."	"The symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary from person to person and depend on the organs affected. Ninety percent of patients with sarcoidosis have the disease in their lungs, where it is usually detected in a routine chest X-ray before symptoms develop. Symptoms for sarcoidosis of the lungs include: | Cough
  Shortness of breath
  Chest pain (ranging from vague tightness to severe pain like a heart attack)
  Weakness
  Fatigue
  Fever
  Weight Loss | Lymph nodes: Sarcoidosis of the lymph nodes can result in granulomas or nodules in the neck, under the chin, arm pits, and groin. When this disease affects the liver, most patients do not report any symptoms and do not require treatment.
  Heart: Cardiac sarcoidosis can lead to shortness of breath, swelling in the legs, and heart palpitations.
  Skin: Here the disease can result in painful red bumps on the legs, arms, nose, cheeks, lips, or ears. Small brownish and painless skin patches can also appear as a result of sarcoidosis.
  Eyes: This disease can also affect the eyes, which can lead to sensitivity to light, burning, itching, tearing, and pain. Chronic inflammation of the eye can lead to glaucoma, cataracts and blindness."	"Doctors diagnose sarcoidosis by first reviewing the patient’s medical history and conducting a physical exam. The doctor may ask about any symptoms and whether they have progressed or eased over time. Next, the diagnosis may be confirmed with a chest X-ray, CT scan, or a microscopic examination of the specimens from the affected tissues or organs. | In the case of sarcoidosis of the lungs, additional tests are performed in order to rule out tuberculosis, including: | Pulmonary Function Testing: This is an objective measure of lung function and involves breathing maneuvers that measure volume of air and airflow in the lungs.
  High Resolution Computed Tomography: This is a special type of CT scan that provides high-resolution images of the lungs.
  Six Minute Walk Testing: This test is an important marker of lung function and evaluates the distance walked and the oxygen saturations achieved while walking.
  Bronchoscopy: In this test, a flexible fiber-optic scope is passed into the lungs to obtain fluid and tissue samples to aid in diagnosis. | When sarcoidosis is present in the nervous system (brain and spinal cord), a positron emission tomography (PET) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help isolate the affected tissue or organ. | When the liver and kidneys appear to be affected, blood tests are used to assess kidney and liver function. An eye exam can diagnose vision problems caused by sarcoidosis. | A biopsy from the affected body part, especially the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes, also helps confirm the diagnosis. | While there is no current cure for sarcoidosis, in most cases the granulomas resolve without other complications. When treatment is required, there are several medications available, especially for sarcoidosis of the lungs. | The first line of treatment for sarcoidosis is corticosteroids, such as prednisone. This is a highly effective anti-inflammatory drug. For mild skin lesions, eye inflammation, or cough, topical steroid creams, eye drops and inhalers may be enough to control the sarcoidosis. For more severe symptoms such as shortness of breath, steroid therapy is effective and has a low rate of relapse.
  For patients who cannot tolerate steroids, there is a range of other available medications. Drugs such as methotrexate (Trezall®) and azathioprine (Azasan®, Imuran®) suppress the immune system and thereby reduce the formation of granulomas.
  Anti-malarial medications can also be prescribed for sarcoidosis of skin and lungs, and colchicine is prescribed for sarcoidosis-related arthritis.
  Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil®) is useful for skin disease and high blood-calcium levels.
  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors are usually used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. These medications can also help treat sarcoidosis that has not responded to other interventions. | Surgery in the form of organ transplant may be recommended if sarcoidosis has severely damaged the patient’s lungs, heart or liver."	There is no way to prevent sarcoidosis since the exact cause remains unknown.	"“Sarcoidosis”. Mayo Clinic.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/arthritis	Arthritis is defined as inflammation of the joints, and is characterized by pain and stiffness around one or more joints. The term arthritis may also be used broadly to describe a number of diseases associated with the breakdown of tissues surrounding the joints, as well as other connective tissues. Severe arthritis can impair limb function; cause deformity of the joints; and, in some cases, affect other organs in the body. | In the United States, the most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout. Some in the medical community include fibromyalgia as a major form of arthritis, while others consider it a separate condition, primarily because one of its characteristics is an absence of joint inflammation or damage. | Depending on the form, arthritis may be caused by aging, autoimmune disorder, infection or other underlying conditions. The main goal of arthritis treatment is to minimize pain and improve physical function. Roughly 50 million Americans report being diagnosed with arthritis, with a higher prevalence in women (24.3%) than in men (18.3%).	"The cause of arthritis for the types common in the United States are summarized below: | Osteoarthritis is associated with normal aging of the joints and affects the joints as well and surrounding tissues (ligaments, cartilage, bone, and lining). The molecular mechanisms responsible for tissue breakdown in osteoarthritis are not fully understood.
  Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder wherein the body attacks and destroys the lining of the joints (synovial membrane), causing inflammation. Other surrounding tissues including the cartilage and bone can also erode over time.
  Gout is a metabolic disorder that affects uric acid homeostasis, leading to uric acid crystal buildup in tissues. Deposits in joints and related tissue can lead to the inflammation and pain of arthritis.
  Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes widespread musculoskeletal pain and other symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbance. The mechanism of disease onset is not known. |  | Risk factors for developing arthritis are as follows: | Family history. Individuals with a family history of arthritis are at a greater risk of inheriting the genetic and environmental factors that lead to disease susceptibility.
  Obesity. Overweight individuals are at a greater risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee.
  Joint injury. Previous joint injury increases the chance of acute arthritis in the affected joint.
  Age and gender. The risk of some types of arthritis increases with age. Rheumatoid arthritis is more prevalent in women, while gout is more prevalent in men.
  Infection. Some microbes can target the joints and eventually cause arthritis."	"The most common symptoms of arthritis are pain and swelling around the affected joint(s). Arthritis symptoms include: | Symptoms and Diagnosis | Family history. Individuals with a family history of arthritis are at a greater risk of inheriting the genetic and environmental factors that lead to disease susceptibility.

  Age and gender. The risk of some types of arthritis increases with age. Rheumatoid arthritis is more prevalent in women, while gout is more prevalent in men.
  Infection. Some microbes can target the joints and eventually cause arthritis."	"The most common symptoms of arthritis are pain and swelling around the affected joint(s). Arthritis symptoms include: | Pain and swelling
  Stiffness and difficulty moving
  Redness and/or warmth
  Limited range of motion. | The first step in diagnosing arthritis is a physical exam to check for swelling, redness, and warmth at the joints. Laboratory tests and visualization methods further help diagnose the disease and assess the extent of tissue damage, respectively. | Laboratory tests. Blood, urine, and joint fluid tests help identify infection, elevated uric acid levels, and other potential causes of arthritis.
  Imaging. A variety of imaging techniques including X-ray, computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound use radiation, radio waves, or sound waves to produce a detailed image of the joints and surrounding tissues.
  Arthroscopy. This technique allows visualization of one specific joint by inserting an arthroscope, which is a thin, flexible tube with a camera. The arthroscope is inserted through a small incision at the joint. | DNA health testing additionally could help to rule out whether you are genetically at higher risk of suffering from hereditary hemochromatosis, which can cause significant joint pain and is caused by an overload of iron stored in your body. | Treatment | Arthritis is not a curable disease, the only exception being infectious arthritis, which can be fully treated with antimicrobials and sometimes surgery to remove infected tissue. In most cases, medication and surgical procedures are used to treat the symptoms of arthritis and improve quality of life. | Medication. A variety of medications are prescribed to treat the symptoms of arthritis. Analgesics like acetaminophen are a class of drugs used to treat pain, while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen treat both pain and inflammation. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic response modifiers are two classes of drugs often used in conjunction to treat rheumatoid arthritis; they act by slowing or blocking the body’s immune system. Corticosteroid drugs like cortisone are used to reduce inflammation and inhibit the body’s immune system.
  Surgery. Surgical procedures used for improving the physical function of affected joints include joint replacement at the knee and hips, and joint fusion of small joints, such as those of the hands.
  Physical therapy. Exercises aim to increase range of motion and condition the muscles that support the joints. This treatment approach can help minimize the painful symptoms of arthritis.
  Home remedies. Staying active with non-weight-bearing exercises (e.g. swimming) and maintaining a healthy weight help improve range of motion and mobility in arthritis patients. Topical hot/cold pads or creams with capsaicin that create a hot sensation on the skin can help minimize pain."	Maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding activities that can injure the joints help prevent the onset of arthritis. Early diagnosis and treatment of arthritis symptoms in at-risk individuals help prevent severe damage to joints and surrounding tissues.	"“Arthritis”. Medline Plus. NIH. May 2014.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia	Fibromyalgia is a common syndrome characterized by chronic, widespread pain and tenderness throughout the body accompanied by other symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and memory problems. In fibromyalgia, joint pain resembles arthritis but differs in that there is no joint disease or inflammation. This tendency to mimic other diseases makes fibromyalgia difficult to diagnose. | The syndrome occurs in 2 to 4% of the population, and approximately 80 to 90% of all cases occur in women. Fibromyalgia typically starts in adulthood but may develop in teens or the elderly as well. | So far, there is no cure for fibromyalgia; however, it is not fatal and does not damage joints or internal organs. Usually a combination of treatments is needed to control the symptoms.	" | The causes of fibromyalgia are unclear. Researchers speculate that the syndrome is caused by a malfunction in the way the brain and spinal cord process pain so that affected individuals become abnormally sensitive to stimuli that are normally not painful, and pain signals become abnormally amplified. Genetics is an important factor since people who have a relative with fibromyalgia are at increased risk for the disorder. Emotional stress, trauma, or other factors may trigger the onset of the illness. | Frequently, fibromyalgia occurs in the presence of other diseases including: | Osteoarthritis
  Rheumatoid arthritis
  Ankylosing spondylitis
  Lupus."	"In fibromyalgia, the predominant symptoms are widespread pain and tenderness all over the body. The pain is accompanied by other symptoms, which collectively diminish the quality of life. | Typical symptoms include: | Tenderness to touch involving joints and muscles, especially in the neck, shoulders, back, and hips
  Unusual fatigue
  Sleep disturbances (awakening tired and unrefreshed)
  Morning stiffness
  Memory or thinking problems
  Headaches
  Depression
  Anxiety
  Irritable bowel syndrome (symptoms of abdominal pain, gas, and a change in bowel habits)
  Irritable bladder
  Pelvic pain
  Painful menstrual periods
  Temporomandibular joint disorders."	"Doctors diagnose fibromyalgia based on a patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings of tenderness in numerous tendons, joints, and muscles. Currently, there are no laboratory tests or X-rays to diagnose fibromyalgia, but tests may be performed to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms. Although often confused with other disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, fibromyalgia is distinguished by the presence of pain with a lack of joint and muscle inflammation. | Treatment | There is no cure for fibromyalgia. The goal of treatment is to control the pain and other symptoms using a combination of medications and a number of other therapies. | Duloxetine (Cymbalta®) and Milnacipran (Savella®) are antidepressant medications that treat fibromyalgia by altering the level of brain chemicals that modulate pain.
  Pregabalin (Lyrica®) inhibits the transmission of pain signals in the body.
  Acetaminophen relieves pain.
  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, can relieve pain even though inflammation is absent.
  Cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and pregabalin may improve sleep problems.
  Opioids (narcotics for pain) are generally avoided because they are not proven effective for fibromyalgia and may exacerbate symptoms. | Cognitive behavioral therapy (to improve a person’s response to pain)
  Tai chi (a stress-reducing exercise accompanied by deep breathing)
  Yoga
  Acupuncture
  Chiropractic therapy
  Massage therapy
  Meditation and other relaxation techniques
  Improved sleep
  Regular exercise
  Healthy diet. | The symptoms of fibromyalgia are usually difficult to treat. Typically, patients need a combination of therapies and a team of various health professionals to implement the necessary regimens and improve the quality of life."	Research has not determined ways to prevent fibromyalgia since the cause is unknown and some people have a genetic predisposition for the disorder. Doctors have no specific recommendations, but their general advice includes a set of lifestyle choices to maintain overall good health - namely, stress reduction, proper sleep, regular exercise, and a nutritious diet.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/herniated-disc	The spine consists of a column of bones called vertebrae, which enclose and protect the spinal cord and its branches (nerve roots). Vertebrae are separated from each another by intervertebral discs - circular pads that provide cushioning, shock absorption, and spinal flexibility. These discs are composed of a soft gel-like center (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by a tough outer ring of fibrous cartilage (annulus fibrosus). | A herniated disc develops when the soft nucleus pulposus bulges out into the spinal canal. This protrusion, commonly known as a slipped disc or ruptured disc, is a problem because it can compress and irritate a nearby spinal nerve root. | Frequently, herniated discs occur in middle-aged people following strenuous activity, but in many cases there is no precipitating event. The most common location for a herniated disc is the low back (lumbar spine). This disorder sometimes affects the neck (cervical spine) but rarely affects the middle back (thoracic spine).	" | As adults age, the discs tend to deteriorate in a process called disc degeneration that narrows the spaces between vertebrae and increases the likelihood of disc herniation. | Herniated discs are associated with certain risk factors: | Back or neck injury
  Straining
  Lifting objects improperly
  Obesity
  Smoking"	"Most lumbar disc herniations develop between the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae or between the 5th lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. Cervical disc herniations most likely occur between the 5th and 6th cervical vertebrae or between the 6th and 7th cervical vertebrae. | Herniated discs usually elicit symptoms on one side of the body as the protruding disc presses on the spinal nerve roots at the corresponding level of the spine. The resulting nerve root irritation (radiculopathy) manifests as pain, numbness, and weakness in the extremity supplied by the affected nerve. |  | Symptoms of a lumbar herniated disc include: | Low back pain.
  Shooting pain from the buttocks to the leg (termed sciatica because the pain travels down the sciatic nerve).
  Tingling and numbness in the buttock or leg (paresthesias).
  Weakness in one or both legs.
  Loss of bowel or bladder control (occurs when a large disc protrusion injures the cauda equina, a group of nerve roots resembling a horse’s tail, at the bottom of the spinal canal). This emergency, called cauda equina syndrome, must be immediately treated with surgery. | Symptoms of a cervical herniated disc include: | Pain in neck.
  Pain in the shoulders.
  Pain that shoots down the arm.
  Tingling and numbness in the shoulder or arm.
  Weakness in one or both arms.
  Rarely, numbness and weakness in the legs (from pressure on the spinal cord)."	"A physical examination may reveal decreased feeling, weakness, or diminished deep tendon reflexes in the area of the extremity served by the affected nerve root. | For lumbar herniated discs, a positive straight leg raising test confirms nerve root compression when a patient experiences pain down the back of the leg upon lifting the leg with a straight knee. |  | X-rays of the spine may show degeneration of disc spaces but cannot show details about the discs themselves.
  Computed tomography (CT) provides much more detailed images of the spinal structures.
  Magnetic resonance (MRI) uses radio waves and a powerful magnet to create additional images of the spinal structures and surrounding tissues.
  Myelogram involves injecting dye in the spinal fluid followed by X-rays to take pictures of the spinal canal. | Electromyography evaluates the function of nerves and muscles.
  Nerve conduction studies test how well the electrical signals travel in the nerves. |  | Overall, 90% of patients are effectively managed with nonsurgical treatments: | Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, decrease swelling and pain.
  Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine, relieve muscle spasms. Side effects may include drowsiness.
  Medications for nerve injury (neuropathic pain) include pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine. Side effects include dizziness, fatigue, and drowsiness.
  Narcotics, for severe pain, include oxycodone and hydrocodone. Side effects include sedation, nausea, and constipation.
  Epidural steroid medication (injected into the space just outside of the sac of spinal fluid), reduces swelling, inflammation, and pain.
  Physical therapy and back-strengthening exercises are more effective treatments than bed rest.
  A soft cervical collar may help alleviate neck pain. | Most cases resolve with nonsurgical treatment; however, after 6 weeks, surgery is indicated for patients experiencing persistent pain, progressive weakness, or difficulty walking. Emergencies, like cauda equina syndrome, require immediate surgery to prevent permanent nerve injury and loss of function. | Microdiscectomy is the most common procedure for lumbar herniated disc. In this surgery, a microscope allows the surgeon to view the structures and remove the protruding portion of the disc through a small incision. | In the neck, an anterior cervical fusion is performed with an incision on the front of the neck. Most of the disc is removed and replaced with a piece of bone graft that joins two vertebrae together and stabilizes the neck."	Techniques for proper lifting, sitting, standing, and posture may prevent herniated discs. When lifting heavy objects, people should use their leg muscles instead of their backs and avoid twisting while lifting. | The results of regular exercise - normal body weight, strong muscles, increased flexibility - promote a healthy spine and decrease the risk of herniated discs.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia	Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach bulges up above the diaphragm into the chest cavity. Normally, the esophagus is positioned in the chest and the stomach is in the abdomen. A small opening (hiatus) in the diaphragm allows the esophagus to pass through to the stomach. Weakness of the diaphragm muscles adjacent to the hiatus allows the stomach to protrude through the hiatus into the chest. | A hiatal hernia may weaken the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the important barrier muscle between the esophagus and stomach, which prevents food and stomach acids from backing up into the esophagus. A weak LES results in a backward flow of stomach contents (acid reflux), causing irritation and inflammation of the lining of the esophagus, a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). | Types of hiatal hernias: | The incidence of hiatal hernia increases with age. Most people experiencing this condition are over age 50 and obese.	"Increased pressure within the abdomen is the main risk factor for this condition. |  | The following factors contribute to development of a hiatal hernia: | Obesity
  Coughing
  Straining with bowel movements
  Heavy lifting
  Vomiting
  Traumatic injury to the diaphragm
  Smoking."	"Most individuals with small hiatal hernias do not experience any symptoms at all. However, large hiatal hernias cause a variety of symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux. These include: | Chest pain (heartburn)
  Upper abdominal pain
  Coughing
  Belching
  Difficulty swallowing. | Severe acid reflux can lead to the following complications: | Esophageal inflammation (esophagitis)
  Narrowing of the esophagus (esophageal stricture)
  Precancerous changes in the lining of the esophagus (Barrett’s esophagus) and an increased risk of developing esophageal cancer."	"Chest pain (heartburn), a common symptom of hiatal hernia and GERD, is difficult to distinguish from the symptoms of heart disease. Therefore, initial tests are often directed at ruling out heart problems. | An evaluation of the esophagus and stomach includes the following procedures: | Upper gastrointestinal series (barium swallow). A procedure in which the patient swallows liquid contrast material, visible with an x-ray, that provides an image of the esophagus and stomach to detect abnormalities such as hiatal hernia.
  Upper endoscopy. A long flexible instrument with a video camera is passed through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach to inspect the tissues for evidence of complications from acid reflux and GERD. | Treatment | Lifestyle and activity modifications include the following: | Lose weight
  Quit smoking
  Avoid heavy lifting
  Avoid bending over
  Improve posture
  Elevate the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches
  Exercise. | Recommended dietary changes include: | Eat small meals more frequently instead of large meals
  Avoid eating within 2 to 3 hours of bedtime
  Avoid foods that worsen GERD symptoms, such as caffeine, chocolate, citrus fruit, tomato sauce, fried or fatty foods, alcohol, and peppermint. | Medications to treat GERD (available over-the-counter and by prescription) include: | Antacids to relieve heartburn and GERD symptoms by neutralizing stomach acids.
  H-2 (histamine) receptor blockers to decrease the production of stomach acid.
  Proton pump inhibitors, which are highly effective for GERD treatment. These medications block stomach acid production, allowing more time for the esophagus to heal. | Surgery is sometimes necessary to repair large fixed (paraesophageal) hiatal hernias when symptoms are uncontrolled with medications. The procedure involves pulling the stomach back down into its normal position, below the diaphragm, and tightening the esophageal hiatus. Various approaches to the surgery include an incision in the chest (thoracotomy), an incision in the abdomen (laparotomy), or tiny incisions in the abdomen through which a small camera and long narrow instruments are inserted (laparoscopy)."	Important measures to prevent hiatal hernia include maintaining a healthy body weight and not smoking. Individuals are generally advised to exercise but avoid excessive heavy lifting, straining, and slouching. Avoiding those foods that trigger acid reflux can prevent GERD symptoms and complications.

Healthy people can have myoclonus in the form of hiccups and “sleep starts”, which are the sudden jerky sensations that can occur as people fall asleep. Myoclonus can also occur due to underlying neurological disorders such as epilepsy, metabolic conditions, or adverse reactions to medications. Importantly, myoclonus is a symptom, not a diagnosis of a disease. | Sudden positive muscle contractions are called positive myoclonus, whereas muscle relaxation is called negative myoclonus. Myoclonus can vary in frequency, and can occur alone or in a sequence. There are several underlying conditions that can give rise to myoclonus symptoms. Doctors aim to isolate and treat the underlying cause of myoclonus symptoms. When the underlying cause cannot be treated or cured, the aim of treatment is to alleviate severe myoclonus. | There are many types of myoclonus and each type may be caused by several underlying problems. Doctors try to identify the underlying cause of the myoclonus, which helps to determine the most appropriate and effective treatment. | Physiological myoclonus occurs in healthy people and rarely requires medical treatment. Examples include hiccups, sleep starts, muscle twitching in infants (especially during sleep), and brief shakes or spasms induced by anxiety or exercise.
  Epileptic myoclonus occurs as part of an underlying epileptic disorder. Subtypes of epilepsy-induced myoclonus include cortical reflex myoclonus, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and reticular reflex myoclonus. Each subtype refers to a form of epilepsy that affects different brain regions.
  Sleep myoclonus occurs just as a person is about to fall asleep. While this symptom can occur in healthy people with no impact on quality of life, sleep myoclonus can also present as restless legs syndrome, which requires medical treatment.
  Essential myoclonus occurs in the absence of any nervous system disorder. It can occur with or without any family history and usually remains stable without changes in severity over time.
  Palatal myoclonus is characterized by a rhythmic contraction of the soft palate (rear of the roof of the mouth). These rapid contractions can persist even during sleep.

  Palatal myoclonus is characterized by a rhythmic contraction of the soft palate (rear of the roof of the mouth). These rapid contractions can persist even during sleep. The condition can also lead to a “clicking” sound in the ear. This form of myoclonus can cause minor discomfort or severe pain. | Causes | Secondary or symptomatic myoclonus can occur due to a variety of underlying medical conditions. Examples include: | Head or spinal cord injuries
  Infections
  Kidney/liver failure
  Lipid storage disease
  Chemical or drug poisoning
  Prolonged oxygen deprivation
  Adverse reaction to medication
  Autoimmune inflammation
  Metabolic diseases. | Secondary myoclonus can also occur due to neurological disorders such as: | Stroke
  Brain tumor
  Huntington’s disease
  Alzheimer’s disease
  Parkinson’s disease and Lewy body dementia
  Corticobasal degeneration
  Frontotemporal dementia
  Multiple system atrophy
  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. | Symptoms | Myoclonus is often described as jerks, shakes and spasms that are involuntary, sudden, brief, and shock-like. The symptoms can vary in intensity and frequency, and may be localized to one body part or be present all over the body. Severe myoclonus can interfere with a person’s ability to walk, talk or eat. | Diagnosis and Treatment | A doctor will typically review a patient’s medical history and perform a physical examination to first diagnose myoclonus. Several tests can be recommended to isolate the underlying cause of the myoclonus. These tests include: | Electroencephalography (EEG): An EEG records the brain’s electrical activity. Small electrodes are attached to the patient’s head and the patient is asked to breathe deeply and look at bright lights or listen to sounds. The EEG can help determine the exact origin of the myoclonus in the brain.
  Electromyography (EMG): An EMG can establish the pattern of the myoclonus by measuring the affected muscles’ electrical discharge. Surface electrodes are placed on the affected muscles and an instrument records the electrical activity as the patient contracts the muscle. The EMG signals can help determine the pattern and origin of the myoclonus.
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI is used to identify tumors or structural abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord, which may be the underlying cause of myoclonus symptoms. Patients are placed inside an MRI scanning machine, which uses magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the brain and spinal cord.
  Laboratory tests: Doctors may suggest a variety of blood, urine, or genetic tests to identify the underlying cause of myoclonus. These tests may help identify diabetes; kidney or liver disease; drugs or toxins; metabolic disorders; and autoimmune disorders. | The most effective way to treat myoclonus is by identifying and treating the underlying cause. When the cause cannot be identified and treated, the goal is to ease the myoclonus symptoms. Medications include: | Tranquilizers: Tranquilizers like clonazepam (Klonopin®) are commonly used to alleviate myoclonus symptoms.
  Anticonvulsants: Anticonvulsants like levetiracetam (Keppra®), valproic acid (Depakene®) and primidone (Mysoline®) are typically used to control epileptic seizures. As such, they can also be effective at reducing myoclonus symptoms.
  Botox: OnabotulinumtoxinA, or Botox, can help treat myoclonus, especially in cases where a discrete body part is affected. This medication works by blocking the chemical messengers that trigger muscle contractions. | Doctors may recommend surgery in cases where myoclonus symptoms are caused by tumors or lesions in the brain or spinal cord. Surgery may also be appropriate for patients who have myoclonus in the face or ear. Deep brain stimulation is currently under investigation as a potential treatment option for myoclonus."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/myositis	"Myositis literally means inflammation (swelling, soreness) of the muscles. General muscle soreness is common and has many causes, including infection, injury, overuse and medication side effects. However, the term “myositis” most commonly refers to a group of diseases also known as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). | In people with IIM, the body’s immune system attacks its own muscle tissue. The resulting inflammation causes pain, swelling and weakness. In addition to the muscles, IIM may affect the skin, joints, lungs, heart and digestive system. | There are many kinds of IIM. The most common are: | Polymyositis (PM) affects the muscles nearest the trunk.
  Dermatomyositis (DM) causes both muscle inflammation and skin rash.
  Inclusion body myositis (IBM) appears to overlap with degenerative muscle disease and mostly affects people over 50.
  Juvenile myositis begins in childhood or adolescence.
  Some IIMs overlap with other health conditions like arthritis or cancer. | Most cases of IIM are chronic, meaning symptoms come and go over a long period of time. Symptoms during flares (periods of active disease) may range from mild to severe and disabling. | IIM is quite rare, affecting only about 20,000 people in the United States. The condition is two to three times more common in females and presents most often in childhood (ages 5-15) and midlife (ages 30-50). An exception is IBM, which is most common in men over 50."	Most experts consider IIM a form of autoimmune disease, which occurs when the body’s own immune system malfunctions and attacks healthy cells. | Normally, when muscle tissue is subjected to infection, injury or irritants, specialized cells within that tissue release substances that open the blood vessels and increase blood flow to the affected area. Special “attack” cells move in to engulf harmful germs and cell debris. This response, called inflammation, is beneficial because it flushes away harmful stimuli and promotes healing of the affected tissues. |  | In a person with autoimmune disease, the immune system sometimes misreads the body’s own cells as dangerous and initiates an inflammatory response against them. It’s not clear what causes autoimmunity, but certain people appear to have a genetic predisposition to it. Environmental triggers may also play a role.	"IIM symptoms vary depending on the specific disease and the body systems involved. The following symptoms are most common: | Muscle pain and tenderness, often appearing first in the hips and shoulders
  Muscle weakness
  Difficulty with every day tasks such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair
  General fatigue (tiredness)
  Difficulty speaking or swallowing
  Shortness of breath or coughing
  Skin rash
  Joint pain and swelling
  Weight loss
  Sensitivity to cold in the extremities (Raynaud’s phenomenon)
  Fever
  Atrophy (loss of muscle mass). | Dermatomyositis and polymyositis symptoms tend to come on gradually over a few weeks or months, whereas IBM may take several years to develop."	"IIM is very difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are nonspecific, meaning they’re common to many other diseases and conditions. | A diagnosis of IIM usually involves: | A thorough patient history and physical exam, including hands-on tests of muscle strength.
  Blood tests for elevated levels of muscle enzymes and/or chemical inflammation markers.
  Electro-diagnostic testing, which uses needles and electrodes to measure muscle and motor nerve activity.
  Muscle or skin biopsy, in which a tissue sample is examined under a microscope.
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to pinpoint areas of muscle weakness.
  Other tests to rule out diseases with similar symptoms. | Medications are the first line of treatment for polymyositis and dermatomyositis. These may include: | Corticosteroids to help suppress the immune system and fight inflammation.
  Immunosuppressive drugs to slow down autoimmune reactions.
  Intravenous immune globulin (a blood product made from human plasma), which can “confuse” the recipient’s immune system and reduce inflammatory activity.
  Biologics (substances derived from the human body) can sometimes relieve symptoms when other therapies fail. | To date, no medications have proved effective in the treatment of IBM. | In addition to medication, people with IIM often benefit from physical therapy to help maintain strength and range of motion. Regular low-impact exercise like aqua therapy may also be helpful. | People with IIM may need to adjust their schedules to allow extra time for sleep as well as periods of rest throughout the day. | Canes, walkers and wheelchairs may help patients stay mobile during flare-ups or in severe cases of the disease. | The prognosis (outlook) for people with IIM varies greatly. Some patients, especially children, recover completely. Others need long-term treatment with medication to reduce flares and manage symptoms. Even when effective, medication therapy may take 2-3 years to achieve beneficial results. | The degree to which IIM impacts quality of life varies greatly. However, most people with the condition can expect to live regular lifespans."	At present, there is no known way to prevent IIM, though research continues in this area.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis	If you hop out of bed in the morning only to be greeted by a stabbing pain in your heel, plantar fasciitis might be the culprit. |  | Plantar fasciitis is an overuse injury of a ligament called the plantar fascia. This tough band of connective tissue runs the length of your foot, linking your heel bone with your toes. Like the string of a bow, it exerts tension that pulls your foot into a slightly arched shape. This allows the foot to give a little with every step, absorbing shock that would otherwise be transmitted upward through your body. | The plantar fascia can take quite a beating, but when it’s overused, tiny tears begin to form. Over time, this can lead to pain, irritation and swelling of the ligament. | Left untreated, plantar fasciitis may turn into a persistent, long-term condition that keeps you from your normal activities. And the problems don’t stop with your foot. People with heel pain often change the way they step to relieve the discomfort. Over time, this abnormal movement can injure other parts of the foot as well as the knees, hips, and back. | If you are coping with plantar fasciitis, you’re in good company. About 2 million people are treated for this condition every year, making it one of the most common causes of foot pain.	The biggest risk factors for developing plantar fasciitis are mechanical issues of the legs and feet. These include high arches, low arches, tight calf muscles or tight Achilles tendons. Risk also increases with age, peaking between 40 and 70 years. | Many people associate plantar fasciitis with runners, and these athletes do tend to be more at risk. This is especially true of those who spend a lot of time running downhill or over uneven surfaces. Other sports that stress the heel include ballet, and aerobic dancing. | Footwear also plays a role. Wearing shoes with poor arch support and cushioning can aggravate the fascia. This is especially true for people like teachers or factory workers, who spend a lot of time standing on hard surfaces. | Finally, obesity likely increases the risk of plantar fasciitis by raising the pressure on the ligaments. | Many people with plantar fasciitis also have a heel spur - a bony overgrowth of the heel bone. In the past, this was believed to be a major contributor to the condition. However, research suggests that heel spurs are often painless, and that many people who have them never develop plantar fasciitis.	The first sign of plantar fasciitis is usually mild heel pain (also called a “stone bruise”) that flares up after exercise. In most cases, pain increases slowly over a period of months. However, it can also come on suddenly, especially after a period of intense activity. | Plantar fasciitis pain usually affects the underside of the heel or arch. You might describe it as stabbing, aching, burning and stiff in character. The pain is often most intense in the morning when you first get out of bed. It may also flare up when you’re standing around, climbing stairs, or getting up after a long sit. Walking or exercise may provide temporary relief, but may lead to even worse pain afterward.	"Heel pain has many causes, including stress fractures, tendonitis, arthritis, nerve irritation, and cysts. For this reason, it’s important to get a proper diagnosis of any pain that is bad enough to keep you from your daily activities for more than a week or two. Your primary care physician will likely refer you to a foot specialist (podiatrist) or sports physician for diagnosis and treatment. | In most cases, plantar fasciitis can be diagnosed by a simple history and physical exam. Your doctor will want to know: | Your pain patterns. Does it change throughout the day? What makes the pain better? Worse?
  Your typical physical activity, including sports and job tasks.
  Any past injuries or foot conditions. | During the physical exam, your doctor will feel your foot to determine the location of the pain and may also check the flexibility of your calf and Achilles tendon. Sometimes imaging tests (MRI or X-rays) are ordered to rule out other conditions. | Treatment | Treatment of plantar fasciitis usually begins with conservative measures, including: | Rest. You may need to stay off the affected foot for a week so as to promote healing.
  Medication. Your doctor may prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen to fight pain and swelling.
  Ice. Massaging the painful area with ice for 15 to 20 minutes several times a day feels great and may speed healing. Some people find it helpful to roll the foot over a frozen water bottle.
  Physical therapy. Research suggests that stretching is one of the best things you can do to treat plantar fasciitis. A physical therapist can show you how to stretch your foot and calf muscle safely at home. He or she may also prescribe strengthening exercises to stabilize the foot and lower leg and show you taping techniques for better arch support.
  Casting and splinting. Your doctor may recommend a special “boot” that holds the arch in a stretched position. In some cases, an additional device called a night splint is worn during sleep. This treatment usually lasts a few weeks.
  Shoes and orthotics. People with plantar fasciitis should wear shoes with low to medium heels, arch support, and lots of cushioning. You may also benefit from padding or a soft silicone heel cup worn inside the shoe to provide additional shock absorption. Orthotic devices can be bought over the counter or custom-fitted. | If your plantar fasciitis doesn’t improve after several months of conservative treatment, your doctor may recommend: | Steroid injections. Steroids are strong medications that can relieve pain for days or weeks when injected near the fascia. However, they also cause weakening of the fascia and shrinking of the fat pad over the heel. For these reasons, they’re rarely used long-term.
  Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). During this treatment, a technician uses a device to direct sound waves into the inflamed area of the foot and stimulate healing. Side effects include bruising, tingling, swelling, numbness, and increased pain.
  Surgery. Surgical treatment may be considered in rare cases when pain lasts a year or longer and other treatments don’t help. One option is an operation called a plantar fascia release, which detaches the ligament from the heel bone. This relieves stress on the fascia but also weakens the arch of the foot. Another type of operation called a gastrocnemius recession is sometimes used to lengthen the calf muscle and relieve pressure on the arch. | About 90 percent of plantar fasciitis cases heal within 10 months with conservative treatment only. Most people feel a lot better within two months. However, a complete recovery may take months to years. | People with a history of plantar fasciitis can prevent a recurrence by stretching their feet regularly, exercising wisely, and wearing supportive shoes."	"Not all cases of plantar fasciitis are preventable. However, there are a few things you can do to promote good foot health: | Maintain a healthy weight.
  Stretch your feet and calves.
  If you’re starting a new sport, build up slowly to give your body time to adjust.
  Wear soft, supportive shoes, especially when standing on hard surfaces.
  Replace athletic shoes regularly.
  Don’t go barefoot.
  Include low-impact activities such as swimming and bicycling in your exercise program."	"Diseases and Conditions: Plantar Fasciitis (Feb 2014). Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/scoliosis	Scoliosis is an abnormal curvature of the spine. The human spine is made of bones called vertebrae that are stacked on top of one another. This flexible structure allows us to bend and twist our bodies in all directions. | A healthy spine curves from front to back at the neck, chest and lower back. However, in people with scoliosis, the spine also develops a side-to-side curvature. This usually happens during the growth spurt that begins just before puberty. | A scoliosis curve can be C- or S-shaped. In severe cases, the spine will rotate and twist, causing the ribs to stick out more on one side. | Most cases of scoliosis are mild and cause no health problems. In severe cases, the twisting of the spine and ribs reduces space within the chest cavity. This can interfere with breathing and put strain on the heart. Untreated scoliosis can also compress and damage the spinal nerves, leading to paralysis. However, these complications are very rare in the United States, because most cases are treated in their early stages. | Scoliosis affects about 3 in every 100 people, or about 6 million people in the United States. It can appear at any age, but usually starts between ages 9 and 15. While scoliosis is equally common in boys and girls, girls are eight times more likely to have severe curves that require treatment.	In 80-85 percent of scoliosis cases, the cause is unknown. This type of scoliosis is called “idiopathic,” meaning “of unknown origin.” Genetics may play a role in cases of idiopathic scoliosis; about 30 percent of children with this type of scoliosis have a close relative with the condition. | In a few cases, scoliosis is caused by another underlying medical condition such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, injury or infection. These conditions can cause muscle weakness and imbalance, which in turn can cause the spine to curve as it grows. | Scoliosis can also result if the bones of the spine do not form properly or separate before birth. Cases of this kind are called “congenital scoliosis.”	"Mild scoliosis can be difficult to detect, because it usually doesn’t cause pain or discomfort. Early symptoms include: | Uneven shoulders
  Uneven waist
  One shoulder blade sticks out more than the other
  One hip is higher than the other. | In more severe cases, you might notice: | Ribs stick out further on one side than the other

The test involves bending over and touching your toes so that a doctor or nurse can examine the position of your spine and ribs. | Diagnosis for scoliosis starts with a physical exam. Your doctor will have you assume different postures to check for evenness of the shoulders, hips and ribs. You also might receive a neurological exam to detect weakness, numbness or abnormal reflexes. | In most cases, a simple X-ray can confirm a diagnosis of scoliosis and show how far the curve has progressed. Children with scoliosis are usually referred to a specialist called an orthopedist or orthopedic surgeon for treatment. |  | Treatment | Many cases of scoliosis do not require treatment. However, your doctor may recommend treatment if the condition is severe or progressing rapidly. Some factors to consider: | Scoliosis tends to be more serious in girls.
  People with large curves, S-shaped curves or curves in the thoracic spine (the chest portion) are at increased risk.
  Curves that are progressing quickly (growing by more than 5 degrees per year) may require more aggressive treatment.
  Age makes a difference. Once you stop growing, mild scoliosis probably will not worsen. However, severe curves (those greater than 50 degrees) may continue to enlarge over time.
  For some children, genetic testing can show whether idiopathic scoliosis is likely to get worse. At present, the test is only available for Caucasian girls between 9 and 13. Researchers are working to expand this test to a wider group of people. | Treatment options for scoliosis include: | Watching and waiting. In mild cases (curves less than 20 degrees), no treatment is necessary. The patient is usually monitored with X-rays every 4 to 6 months to make sure the condition is not worsening.
  Brace. Wearing a brace won’t permanently correct the curve, but it can stop the curve from worsening as you grow. In most cases, an “underarm” brace that covers the lower part of the torso works sufficiently. However, a full-torso brace may be necessary for curves affecting the upper spine or neck. The brace can be removed for showering and (if needed) during physical activity. In most cases, it would be worn both day and night, though this varies from person to person.
  Surgery. A type of surgery called spinal fusion may be used to slow the progress of severe scoliosis and correct the curvature. During the operation, two or more vertebrae (spinal bones) are grafted together using a bonelike material. Plates, screws and other hardware are bolted to the spine to protect the area while the graft hardens. The surgeon also implants a metal rod that attaches to the top and bottom of the affected area. The rod can be lengthened every few months so that it grows with you.
  Social and emotional support. Having a good support system can help teens with scoliosis cope with appearance changes and treatments. Many children find support groups helpful. | Fortunately, scoliosis is rarely life-threatening. While the condition has the potential for severe complications, these are extremely rare, thanks to the treatments now available. | Most people with scoliosis can lead normal, active lives with no restrictions on their activities. Some activity restriction may be necessary in severe cases or following surgery. | There is no known way to prevent scoliosis. | "	"“Information and Support.” The National Scoliosis Foundation. http://www.scoliosis.org/info.php.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/shin-splints	Exercise is a great thing for your body. But working out too hard too soon can lead to shin splints, a painful swelling of the muscles, tendons, and bone tissue at the front of the lower leg. |  | Shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome, cause pain along the inside edge of the tibia, which is the larger of the two bones connecting the knee and foot. They typically come in pairs (one for each leg) and are caused by repetitive pounding movements such as running and jumping. For this reason, they’re usually seen in athletes, especially those who are new to sports. | Shin splints are usually more annoying than dangerous. However, if left untreated, they can progress to stress fractures, which take much longer to heal. They can also be confused with other causes of shin pain, some of which can be dangerous if left untreated. | Shin splints are very common, accounting for about 60 percent of all overuse injuries of the leg. About 10 to 20 percent of runners develop shin splints at some point in their careers.	"Shin splints are almost always caused by repetitive stress associated with weight-bearing exercise. They’re most common in runners, gymnasts, dancers, and people undergoing intense military training such as boot camp. | Shin splints are very common in newer athletes who are just getting into a sport and those who are returning after some time off. They can also happen when you ramp up the duration, distance, or intensity of your workout too quickly (for example, running faster or for longer distances). | Other activities that increase your risk: | Exercising on hard surfaces
  Making frequent starts and stops (such as when playing tennis or basketball)
  Running on hills or uneven terrain
  Exercising in worn out or inappropriate shoes (for example, running in court shoes). | People with flat feet or high arches are more prone to shin splints."	Shin splints cause pain along the front and inner part of the shin. This pain may be sharp or dull. It usually (but not always) appears in both legs around the same time. Touching or pressing the shin area may make the pain worse. | Shin splint pain is usually most noticeable during and after exercise. Severe shin splints may hurt all the time, even when you’re resting. | Some people with shin splints also have mild swelling around the tibia.	"Shin pain has many causes, some of which can be dangerous or long-lasting. For this reason, it’s important to get any significant pain around the tibia examined by a doctor. | Shin splints are usually diagnosed based on history and physical exam. Your doctor may also order imaging tests such as X-rays, bone scan and MRI to rule out other possible causes such as: | Stress fractures - small cracks in the bone due to repetitive stress.
  Tendinitis - inflammation of the fibrous tissue that attaches the muscle to the bone.
  Chronic exertional compartment syndrome - a rare condition in which exercise causes pressure to build within the muscles. | The best thing you can do to treat shin splints is to rest. Avoid the activity that brought on the condition for 2-4 weeks. To keep fit and healthy, switch to low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, or cycling. | Other treatments for shin splints include: | Ice. Apply ice packs for 15-20 minutes four to eight times a day. Wrap the packs in a towel or place them over clothing to protect your skin.
  Medication. Take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed to combat pain and swelling.
  Compression. Wrap the affected area in an elastic bandage to prevent further swelling.
  Footwear. Wear supportive shoes that cushion your feet as your shins heal. If you have flat feet, consider orthotics to provide additional support.
  Physical therapy. A therapist or athletic trainer can help you stretch and strengthen the lower leg and plan for a gradual return to your sport. | Don’t resume the problem activity until you’ve been pain-free for at least two weeks. For your first workouts, start at a very low intensity, distance, and duration and build up slowly. Be sure to warm up properly before the activity, and stop immediately if you feel pain. | With proper care, shin splints usually heal within 3-6 months."	"To keep shin splints from derailing your training, follow these safety tips: | Wear good quality, sport-specific shoes while exercising. Staff at specialty running stores can analyze your foot structure and stride and recommend shoe models that compensate for your weak areas.
  Track your total run distance and replace your shoes every 350 to 500 miles.
  If you have flat feet, consider wearing orthotics for additional arch support. Basic orthotics are available over the counter. These devices can also be custom-made to fit your foot.
  When starting a new exercise program, build your distance, intensity, and duration slowly.
  Include some low-impact cross training in your program. Exercises like biking, walking, and swimming give your shins a rest while providing a good cardiovascular workout.
  Do some strength training at least once a week. Exercises that target the lower leg such as calf raises are especially beneficial."	"Shin Splints (Jan. 2014).

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea	Sleep apnea is a disorder in which a person repeatedly stops breathing during sleep. This disorder is characterized by episodes of shallow breathing or long pauses (apneic events). |  | Sleep apnea commonly occurs in both children and adults. The condition affects both men and women, but it is much more prevalent in men.	"Overweight or obese people are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea because of an increased amount of fat in the airway tissues. In children, sleep apnea is often associated with enlarged tonsils and adenoids. | Risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea include: | Male gender
  Obese thick neck
  Abnormal jaw or facial features
  Narrowed airway
  Enlarged tongue
  Enlarged tonsils
  Enlarged uvula
  Advanced age
  Smoking. | In central sleep apnea, the brain malfunctions and fails to properly maintain breathing. This disorder can be caused by heart failure or stroke. Central sleep apnea is more prevalent in people over age 60."	"Individuals with sleep apnea are typically unaware of their condition and have no recall of the apneic episodes occurring while they are asleep. Family members or bed partners observe loud snoring, repeated apneic events, choking, and gasping during sleep. Sleeping on the back exacerbates these episodes compared to sleeping on the side. | People with sleep apnea experience numerous sleep interruptions all night long. This problem deprives their bodies of deep restorative sleep, causing numerous daytime symptoms. | The following symptoms are frequently associated with sleep apnea: | Loud snoring
  Breathing that starts and stops during sleep
  Fatigue
  Daytime sleepiness
  Falling asleep at work or while driving
  Irritability and mood swings
  Memory problems
  Difficulty concentrating
  Dry mouth
  Morning headache. | Over time, the frequent drops in blood oxygen level and poor sleep quality cause harmful increases in stress hormones and serious complications may occur, including: | High blood pressure
  Heart failure
  Heart attack
  Stroke
  Abnormal heart beats (arrhythmias)."	"The diagnosis is easily missed because people with the condition are asleep when the problem is occurring. Since not everyone who snores has sleep apnea, a complete medical evaluation is required. The physical examination of a person with obstructive sleep apnea may reveal an enlargement of the tongue, tonsils, or uvula. Often further testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. | During a sleep study, sensors are applied to monitor a person’s breathing, vital signs, and oxygen level during sleep. This test, known as polysomnography, is usually performed overnight in a special sleep center. | Treatment | Weight loss removes a prominent cause of obstructive sleep apnea.
  Avoid smoking.
  Avoid alcohol.
  Avoid sedative medications.
  Special pillows or devices promote sleeping on the side instead of the back.
  A mouthpiece can help to keep the airway open.
  A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask is a device placed over the mouth and nose (or just the nose). It blows air into the throat. The increased air pressure in the throat keeps the airway open during sleep.
  Surgery can remove the excess tissue that is narrowing the airway.
  Surgery can also reposition the jaw."	Maintaining normal body weight is a very important factor in decreasing the risk for obstructive sleep apnea. Other lifestyle choices, such as quitting smoking and avoiding excess alcohol, are also beneficial.	"What Is Sleep Apnea?

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/stickler-syndrome	Stickler syndrome is a progressive genetic disease of the connective tissue that causes abnormalities with vision, hearing and skeletal development. The name comes from Dr. G. B. Stickler, who initially described the condition in 1965. It is mostly diagnosed during infancy or childhood, and is usually not tied to learning or other intellectual disabilities. Patients with Stickler syndrome may suffer from hearing loss, retinal detachments and loose joints. Poor facial development can also result in a flat-looking face with a small nose and chin. Children can also develop features of Pierre Robin sequence, which include a cleft palate (opening in the roof of the mouth), an enlarged tongue and a shrunken lower jaw. There is no cure for Stickler syndrome, but treatment is available for managing the symptoms.	 | Stickler syndrome is caused by a genetic error, or mutation, in genes that produce collagen - the building blocks of connective tissue. The three main collagen genes associated with this condition are COL2A1, COL11A1 and COL11A2, which carry the genetic instruction for producing collagen for the eye and joints. | Stickler syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. This means anyone with Stickler syndrome has a 50% chance of passing down the disease to each of his or her offspring. A less common, autosomal recessive form of the disease is associated with the COL9A gene. In this case, a child must inherit two mutated copies of the gene, one from each parent, to develop Stickler syndrome. These genes do not account for every form of Stickler syndrome, and some first-time cases are due to a random gene mutation that is not present in either parent.	"The symptoms of Stickler syndrome vary. Even affected members in the same family can experience symptoms with varying severities. Known symptoms include: | Vision abnormalities: Severe nearsightedness is one of earliest signs of Stickler syndrome. Inadequate collagen inside the eye can also lead to retinal detachments, glaucoma and cataracts.
  Hearing challenges: Hearing loss, especially with high frequency sound waves, and frequent ear infections are associated with Stickler syndrome.
  Skeletal and joint problems: Stickler syndrome causes a range of developmental problems in the face, spine and joints. These include a shorter stature due to abnormal spine curvature, overly flexible joints and early onset of osteoarthritis. Abnormal musculoskeletal development in the face can cause a flattened face with a smaller-than-average nose and chin. A cleft palate is present in some infants.
  Heart valve defect: Roughly 50% of children with Stickler syndrome have a poorly functioning heart valve."	"Stickler syndrome is diagnosed based on a physical exam and a review of the patient’s medical history. Genetic tests are also available to detect mutations in some collagen-producing genes. | Genetic testing: Tests that look for mutations in the COL2A1, COL11A1 and COL11A2 genes can assist in diagnosing the autosomal dominant form of Stickler syndrome. Since the associated mutations for all forms of the disease are not known, other tests are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. Genetic counselors can help patients understand the test results and cope with emotional challenges that may arise.
  Vision tests: Eye exams help to detect abnormalities of the retina or the jelly-like substance inside the eye. The exams also look for glaucoma, cataracts and nearsightedness, which is a common feature of Stickler syndrome.
  Hearing exam: These tests check for the patient’s ability to hear sounds in varying volume and pitch.
  Imaging test: Imaging tests (e.g., X-ray) produce a picture of the skeletal system and allow physicians to inspect the spine and joint health. | Although there is no cure for Stickler syndrome, the symptoms can be managed with treatment. Early treatment and continuous monitoring in young children is critical in order to prevent blindness, deafness, difficulty breathing or eating, and other complications. | Medications: Over-the-counter drugs help alleviate joint pain and stiffness. Patients with glaucoma may require daily medicated drops to relieve pressure inside the eye.
  Speech therapy: Children who experience hearing loss at a young age may require speech therapy to pronounce some sounds. Hearing aids can also help improve language and socialization skills.
  Special education: Vision and auditory challenges can affect how well children learn in school. Special programs that are focused on a child’s unique needs can help.
  Face/neck surgery: Surgery can be used to address some of structural abnormalities in the face. A tracheostomy allows infants with obstructed breathing to breathe normally through a temporary hole in the neck. Surgical procedures for lengthening the lower jaw or correcting a cleft palate are also available.
  Eye surgery: Patients with glaucoma and cataracts may require corrective surgery to prevent blindness.
  Ear tube placement: Children with Stickler syndrome acquire frequent ear infections. Placing a short tube inside the ear helps drain fluids that lead to infection.
  Joint care: Affected children and adults who participate in contact sports must protect their joints. Early onset of arthritis may necessitate joint replacement surgery."	Stickler syndrome is an inherited condition and cannot be prevented. Genetic screening can help affected adults assess disease risk to their offspring. Early diagnosis and treatment is key to preventing serious complications.	"“Stickler Syndrome”. UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/tendinitis-and-tendinosis	"Tendons are cord-like bands of tissue that connect muscles to bone. Tendon tissue is made of a tough, fibrous substance called collagen that can withstand quite a bit of force and tension. However, severe forces or repetitive force over time can cause tiny “microtears” in tendon tissue, leading to injury. |  | Tendinitis is inflammation (redness, swelling, heat, soreness) that occurs when the body’s immune system detects an injury and responds. In the case of tendinitis (also spelled ‘tendonitis’), the body increases the flow of blood and infection-fighting substances to the injured tendon. | Tendinosis is a degenerative injury to the tendon that doesn’t provoke an immune response. It occurs when repetitive, unrelenting stress over time causes the breakdown of collagen, growth of abnormal blood vessels, and thickening of the tendon’s sheath (covering). Research suggests that many injuries diagnosed as tendinitis are actually tendinosis. | Tendon injuries occur in all parts of the body, but are most common in these parts: | Thumb
  Shoulder
  Elbow
  Wrist
  Hip
  Knee
  Achilles tendon (which connect the calf muscle to the heel bone) | Many common sports afflictions, including tennis elbow, swimmer’s shoulder, and jumper’s knee are actually forms of tendinitis/tendinosis. | Tendon injury usually isn’t serious in itself. On the other hand, weakened tendons increase a person’s risk of further injuries, like sprains. In severe cases, the tendon may rupture (tear) and require surgical repair."	"Sudden, severe trauma can damage the tendons instantly. However, most tendon injuries are caused by repetitive injury. Even a relatively minor stress can tear and degrade the tendon tissue if it’s repeated over and over. Examples include: | Work tasks such as typing, clicking a mouse, clenching a steering wheel or using power tools
  Hobbies like gardening, shoveling, raking and painting
  Sports such as golf, tennis, baseball, basketball, bowling, running and swimming. | Poor posture and form during these repeated movements can increase stress on the tendons and make injury more likely. | In unusual cases, tendinitis/tendinosis is caused by infection or a reaction to medication. | The incidence of tendon injury increases with age, and it’s especially common after age 40. Some medical conditions can increase the risk, including arthritis, gout, and thyroid disorders."	Symptoms of a tendon injury usually occur near a joint at the attachment point between the bone and muscle. | The first sign is often dull, aching pain that worsens with movement. The affected area is frequently tender to the touch. Some mild swelling may be present. | People with tendinitis of the shoulder may notice an occasional “snapping” sound during movement and may experience freezing (loss of motion) in the shoulder joint.	"Tendon injury is usually mild and doesn’t require a doctor’s care. To care for tendinitis/tendinosis at home: | Avoid activities that aggravate the injured area, but do try to go about your daily routine as much as you are able.
  To reduce swelling, apply cold packs for up to 20 minutes 1-2 times on the day pain starts. (But do not apply ice directly to the skin.)
  Compress the area with an elastic bandage to further reduce swelling.
  After swelling has stopped, apply heat from a heating pad or hot bath to relieve pain and promote healing.
  If possible, elevate the area to promote circulation.
  To control pain and swelling, take over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen.
  After a few days of rest, try gently moving the affected are to prevent joint stiffness. | See a doctor if: | Pain interferes with your activities and persists for more than a few days
  Pain worsens rapidly
  You have a fever
  The painful area is swollen, red and warm to the touch
  Joint pain occurs in more than one place. | A physician can usually diagnose tendinitis based on a patient’s history and physical exam. Imaging tests such as ultrasound, X-ray, or MRI may be ordered to rule out other types of injury. Blood tests can detect infection, which is a rare cause of tendon injury. | Treatment | Treatment for severe or persistent tendinitis may include: | Physical therapy to strengthen the tendons and muscles and preserve range of motion. Therapy may include exercises and fitting of splints, braces, and orthotics.
  Injections of corticosteroids (powerful anti-inflammatory medications) into the area around the tendon. This helps relieve swelling and pain, but may increase the risk of tendon rupture.
  Surgical repair is used in rare cases to repair ruptured tendons or those that don’t respond to more conservative treatment. | With proper management, most tendon injuries improve within a few weeks, though some take several months to heal."	"To protect your tendons from injury: | Stop and rest if you notice pain during any activity.
  Make sure your workspace follows ergonomic principles. Your chair height, desktop height and keyboard position should be matched to your arm length. Many workplaces provide free ergonomic consults.
  Make sure your sports equipment and clothing is in good condition, suited to your sport and conforms to the latest safety standards. This is especially important with athletic shoes.
  Train properly. When starting a new sport or after a period of inactivity, ramp up your exertion level gradually so your muscles have a chance to strengthen and adjust.
  Stretch properly before and after exercise to improve range of motion.
  Use good technique and form when playing sports. Consider professional coaching when beginning a new sport or using a new piece of exercise equipment.
  Work occasional cross-training into your regimen to give your tendons and joints a rest. (For example, a runner might choose to bike or swim once a week.)"

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/tmj-disorders	Temporomandibular joint disorders (often called TMD) are painful conditions of the jaw joint and muscles of the head and neck. The temporomandibular joints (TMJ) connect the lower jaw (mandible) to the temporal bones, and their hinge-like function is essential in activities such as chewing, talking, and swallowing. |  | TMJ disorders are very common problems, which occur more frequently in women than men. Although some types of TMJ disorders result in severe symptoms, most cases are mild and resolve with self-care or minimal treatment.	"Temporomandibular joint disorders may result from problems with the muscles and soft tissues around the joint or problems within the joint itself. Often, though, the specific cause of an individual’s TMJ disorder is unclear. | Muscle pain. Some cases of TMJ disorders are attributed to muscle tension and stress. Habits such as teeth clenching and grinding may result in muscle soreness, muscle spasms, and pain.
  Jaw joint issues. TMJ disorders can result from displacement of the soft disc, termed an articular disc, inside the temporomandibular joint itself. This disc is a cushioning material within the joint that normally absorbs shock during chewing. Jaw trauma, injury, or dislocation can lead to a TMJ disorder.
  Arthritis. Arthritis is a joint disease that causes joint inflammation throughout the body, including the temporomandibular joints."	" | The symptoms of TMJ disorders are often mild and typically come and go over a period of time. Most individuals experience short-term problems, although, some individuals develop persistent or severe pain. | The following are the most common symptoms associated with TMJ disorders: | Pain in the jaw and muscles of the face and neck
  Headache
  Earache
  Clicking or popping noises in the jaw joint
  Jaw stiffness
  Difficulty opening the mouth (jaw locking)
  Difficulty eating and swallowing
  Difficulty talking."	"Clinicians diagnose TMJ disorders based on a patient’s history, symptoms, and physical examination. Occasionally, x-rays are used to provide an image of the jaw and neck. Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging are additional studies, which provide highly detailed images of the bones and soft tissues. | Most TMJ problems are temporary and resolve spontaneously with little or no treatment. For mild joint pain, self-care and conservative treatments are often very effective. | Resting the jaw joint
  Ice pack applied to jaw
  Soft diet
  Stress reduction
  Physical therapy and jaw exercises
  Pain medications. | Bite guards (stabilization splints), plastic devices placed between the upper and lower jaw, help reduce clenching and grinding.
  Corticosteroid medication, injected into the joint, decreases inflammation.
  Botulinum toxin (Botox®), injected into adjacent facial muscles, reduces jaw tension and pain.
  Surgery is sometimes performed to repair a damaged joint and surrounding tissues. Such surgery is very rarely recommended to treat TMJ disorders, because it is often ineffective and may result in additional complications."	Avoiding stress and teeth grinding helps prevent certain TMJ disorders. Maintenance of good posture prevents excessive straining of the facial and neck muscles and may decrease a person’s risk of developing TMJ problems. Additionally, healthy lifestyle habits such as relaxation techniques, proper diet, and adequate sleep are generally recommended as preventative health measures.	"TMJ Disorders.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/water-on-the-knee	“Water on the knee” is common term for knee effusion, a condition in which excess fluid accumulates around the knee joint. Such effusions happen for many reasons. The most common ones are injury, overuse, and chronic health conditions like osteoarthritis. |  | Your knee joint connects your femur (upper leg bone) to the tibia and fibula (lower leg bones) with three large ligaments. On each side of the joint is a meniscus, a crescent-shaped wedge of cartilage (soft bony tissue). The meniscus is slippery and provides cushioning and lubrication to help the ends of the bones move smoothly over one another. | Like most joints, the knee is contained within a “capsule” - a membrane that normally contains less than an ounce of lubricating joint fluid. However, an injury or illness can cause extra fluid to build up around the joint. The results are swelling, pain and restricted range of motion. In severe cases, it may be impossible to walk or even put weight on the affected knee. | Water on the knee usually isn’t dangerous in itself, but it can be a sign of a more serious medical condition. In addition, prolonged swelling can cause the leg muscles to weaken. This is especially dangerous in older people, because it increases the risk of falls. Another potential complication is Baker’s cyst, a fluid filled sac that forms at the back of the knee. Occasionally these cysts get so large or bothersome that a physician must drain them. | Water on the knee is more common in people who have significant “wear and tear” on their joints. Age, previous injury, and obesity are all risk factors. People who play sports or practice very physical occupations are also more likely to experience a knee effusion.	"Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of water on the knee. This condition develops as the meniscus wears away due to repetitive stress and injury over time. Without the lubricating effect of cartilage, friction increases, and the knee becomes swollen and painful to use. | Trauma is another common cause of effusion. Twisting, hyperextension, a sudden stop or a direct blow to the knee can damage the bones, ligaments and meniscus, resulting in pain and swelling. | Interestingly, many diseases can cause knee problems, including some that may have origins elsewhere in the body. Some examples: | Rheumatoid arthritis - An autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the body’s own cells.
  Infections - Lyme disease, brucellosis, tuberculosis, and gonorrhea can all affect the knee.
  Gout - When levels of uric acid in the blood get too high, the acid can crystallize in the joints.
  Bursitis - Swelling of the small, fluid-filled sacs that separate your knee bones from nearby muscles and tendons.
  Tumors - Both cancerous and benign masses sometimes infiltrate the knee."	"You might have water on the knee if you notice: | Swelling. The skin around the kneecap looks and feels puffy compared to the other knee.
  Stiffness. Range of motion decreases. The leg is difficult to completely bend or straighten. Depending on the cause, you might also notice instability, clicking, or locking of the knee.
  Pain. This can range from mild to severe, depending on the cause. | Swelling that appears in the absence of an injury may be caused by an infection. Additional symptoms include fever, chills, redness, or hotness. | Recent research suggests that a swollen knee can sometimes be the first sign of Lyme disease, a potentially serious bacterial infection spread by tick bites. Knee swelling due to Lyme disease is usually pronounced and develops quickly, but is not typically painful. It can occur in the absence of other common Lyme disease symptoms like rash or fever. Left untreated, Lyme disease can lead to permanent joint damage. | Tumor-related swelling may be accompanied by fever, night pain and sweating, and unexplained weight loss."	"Mild knee swelling due to an injury or previously diagnosed condition may not require medical attention. Instead: | Rest. Try not to walk or put weight on the leg.
  Ice. Place ice in a plastic bag, wrap it in a towel, and apply if to the knee for 15 to 20 minutes every two to four hours.
  Elevate. When sitting, elevate your knee above your waist. Place pillows underneath your knee when sleeping to raise it above your heart.
  Use pain relievers. Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol®) or ibuprofen (Advil®, Motrin®) can help make you more comfortable. | See a doctor if your knee is very swollen or doesn’t improve with home care. Also see a doctor if you notice infection symptoms like fever, redness or hotness. It’s a good idea to seek help if you don’t know what caused the swelling (in other words, it’s not related to an injury or diagnosed medical condition). | Primary care providers can diagnose and treat many straightforward knee problems. Depending on the findings, your provider may refer you to an orthopedist (skeletal system specialist) for further treatment. | A workup for water on the knee may include: | History and physical - Your provider will want to hear about your symptoms, the date and mechanism of injury, and how soon swelling appeared. You may also be asked about your recent activities, past injuries, and surgeries.
  X-rays - This imaging test is good at revealing dislocated and broken bones as well as some cases of arthritis.
  Ultrasound - Another imaging test used to detect abnormalities in the bones, ligaments and tendons.
  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - The most sensitive imaging test for soft-tissue abnormalities, including those of the tendons, ligaments, and cartilage.
  Joint aspiration - With the knee numbed by anesthetic, the doctor uses a needle to draw out some fluid from the joint capsule. This can be analyzed for the presence of blood, bacteria, or uric acid crystals. | Treatment | Next steps will vary depending on the underlying issue causing your knee effusion. Your provider’s goals include reducing swelling, relieving pain, improving function, and treating any underlying illnesses. | Medications - Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that fight inflammation. They can be taken orally or injected into the affected joint.
  Physical therapy - This involves a course of exercises to improve strength and range of motion. Your therapist might also provide treatments like splinting, icing, or ultrasound to promote healing.
  Arthrocentesis - With the knee numbed, the doctor uses a needle to draw fluid out of the joint. This helps relieve pain and pressure.
  Arthroscopy - With the patient under sedation, the doctor threads an arthroscope (flexible tube with a camera in the end) into the knee. Tools can be passed through the tube to repair damage to the cartilage and remove loose tissue.
  Joint replacement - In cases of severe osteoarthritis, the knee joint can be replaced with a prosthetic to relieve pain and improve function. | The course of water on the knee depends on its cause. | Osteoarthritis is incurable once it develops, but can often be managed with activity, physical therapy, and medication. In severe cases, surgery can greatly improve function. | People who have had a severe knee sprain or fracture are at increased risk for chronic (long-term) pain, stiffness, and joint instability. They may also be more likely to develop osteoarthritis as they get older."	"To reduce your risk of knee pain and swelling: | Keep your leg muscles strong. This helps to keep your knee stable and relieve pressure on the joint. Weight-bearing exercises like walking, jogging, weight training, and even gardening are good for building strength.
  Prevent overuse injuries. Give your knee a rest by working low-impact activities like swimming or cycling into your routine. If you’re just getting back into training, start slow and build up gradually.
  Watch your weight. Maintaining a healthy size reduces the stress on your joints and minimizes wear and tear."	"Diseases and Conditions: Swollen Knee (2015).

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease	Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia, a brain disease in which a person’s memory and thinking (cognitive) abilities progressively worsen over time. In addition to significant memory loss, patients with Alzheimer’s disease experience impaired communication, inability to concentrate, loss of judgment, and visual problems. Alzheimer’s disease is incurable, and individuals with the condition eventually become completely unable to communicate or perform any normal activities of life. | Women have a greater risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease than men. The condition usually affects older adults after age 60; however, there is a much less common form of the condition, termed early-onset Alzheimer’s disease that occurs between ages 30 to 60.	Different types of dementia damage the brain in different ways. In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, the brain develops high levels of abnormal proteins (beta-amyloid plaques) and tangles of fibrous material (tau tangles). As the beta-amyloid plaques and tangles increase, the nerve cells (neurons) in the brain become damaged and stop working properly. Consequently, the brain shrinks in size and loses function. Research suggests that the disease slowly starts damaging the brain many years before symptoms develop. | The initial trigger for Alzheimer’s disease is unknown, but Alzheimer’s has been linked to the same factors that cause heart disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol level, and smoking. Other factors include advanced age, a family history of Alzheimer’s disease, low levels of dietary vegetables and fruit, low levels of physical activity, limited social activities, low levels of mental stimulation, and a history of head injury. | Lastly, advances in genetic science reveal that some of us are at genetically higher risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease than others; find out more about DNA health testing to decide if it’s something you want to pursue.	"The main symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include memory loss, loss of language skills, inability to concentrate, and impaired judgment. The disease actually starts several years before any symptoms are experienced, and the initial symptoms are very mild because the disease progresses so slowly. Alzheimer’s disease starts by striking the hippocampus (the key area of the brain for learning and memory); therefore, one of the earliest symptoms is memory loss - particularly the inability to remember newly learned information. Eventually, the disease affects other parts of the brain, resulting in language problems, visual problems, behavioral abnormalities, loss of function, and profound debilitation. |  | Memory loss, especially recently learned information, such as difficulty remembering dates and recent events or needing repeated reminders
  Difficulty speaking, problems finding words, and inability to carry on a conversation
  Difficulty with counting or simple calculations
  Problems with completing familiar tasks, such as forgetting how to drive home
  Misplacing objects and accusing others of stealing
  Vision problems
  Impaired judgment
  Confusion and disorientation with changes in environment, such as not knowing where they are or how they got there
  Difficulty performing daily activities
  Personality changes
  Agitation, anxiety, and depression
  Hallucinations
  Delusions
  Withdrawal from social activities
  Sleep difficulties
  Inability to speak, swallow, eat, or walk."	"When Alzheimer’s disease is suspected, laboratory tests are performed to rule out other causes of dementia, such as a vascular dementia, which is caused by strokes. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide detailed images of the brain and are performed to check for other brain disorders, such as a brain tumors or strokes. In order to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, patients undergo several tests of memory, attention, language, and math skills. Patients are also evaluated for personality changes and their ability to perform activities of daily living. | Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible condition. There is no cure or treatment to stop the progression of this disease; however, there are some treatments to temporarily alleviate some of the symptoms. | Cholinesterase inhibitors help memory loss and thinking problems by increasing the level of acetylcholine, a naturally occurring chemical that aids communication between nerve cells.
  Memantine improves memory and other cognitive abilities by regulating a chemical in the body called glutamate.
  High dose vitamin E is an antioxidant that may protect brain cells from injury. | Antidepressants to treat depressed moods
  Anxiolytics to treat anxiety
  Antipsychotic medications for hallucinations and agitation. | Comfort measures to manage pain, hunger, thirst, etc.
  Calm, reassuring environment
  Adequate rest."	Currently, there is no known way to prevent Alzheimer’s disease; however, there are numerous ongoing research studies in search of ways to prevent the onset of the disease or halt its progression. | Previous studies have suggested that Alzheimer’s disease is associated with many of the risk factors for heart disease. All individuals are advised to avoid smoking, control high blood pressure and diabetes, and consume a healthy diet high in vegetables and fruit, because these measures may be beneficial in lowering the risk for both diseases. | Other studies have shown that higher levels of education, mentally challenging activities, stimulating jobs, and engagement in frequent social activities may also reduce a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/astigmatism	"If you catch yourself squinting at the television, driving slowly at night, or wondering why your image looks distorted in the mirror, astigmatism may be the culprit. | Astigmatism is a common eye condition that causes blurred vision at distances close and far. It happens when the cornea (clear front surface of the eye) or lens (a clear structure inside the eye) has an unusual shape. | Like a camera, your eye must focus all of the light rays that enter your eye from different directions down to a single point in order to create a clear picture. Normally, this happens as light passes through the curved surfaces of the cornea and lens. When these surfaces are evenly curved (like the surface of a ball), they refract (bend) the light rays and focus them on the retina, a light-sensing organ at the back of the eye. (The retina then converts the light patterns into electrical signals, which are sent to the brain via the optic nerve and interpreted as the “picture” we see.) | In reality, almost no one has a perfectly shaped cornea or lens. Steep or flat spots bend light in irregular ways, causing images to focus in front of and behind the retina. This is called a refractive error, and the result is blurry or distorted vision. | Astigmatism sometimes happens alongside other refractive errors, including: | Nearsightedness: Light focuses in front of the retina, causing distant objects to blur.
  Farsightedness: Light focuses behind the back of the eye, making nearer objects blur. | Astigmatism can cause eyestrain, leading to headaches and eye discomfort. Children with astigmatism often don’t realize their vision is abnormal, which can cause them difficulties with school and sports."	In most cases, the exact cause of astigmatism is unknown. The tendency to develop this condition appears to run in families. | A few people develop astigmatism after an eye injury or surgery. A condition called keratoconus, which causes progressive thinning and bending of the cornea, eventually leads to severe astigmatism. | Contrary to popular belief, astigmatism isn’t caused or aggravated by reading in the dark or sitting too close to the TV.	The most common symptom of astigmatism is blurred vision, which occurs at both near and far distances. The blurring can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or any combination of these. In some cases, objects also look distorted (too tall, short, wide, or narrow). People with astigmatism often report difficult driving at night. | Squinting due to untreated astigmatism can lead to eyestrain, which in turn causes discomfort and headaches. | People with very mild astigmatism often don’t notice any symptoms.	"If you notice any changes in your vision that interfere with your activities, see an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) for a comprehensive exam. Depending on your needs, this may include: | Visual acuity testing: You’ll be asked to read letters of various sizes off an eye chart from a distance of 20 feet.
  Keratometry: The ophthalmologist uses reflected light from a device called a keratoscope to measure the curvature of the cornea.
  Computerized corneal mapping: This involves running a keratoscope with a video camera over the cornea’s entire surface to create a detailed picture of its shape.
  Refraction testing: The ophthalmologist places a series of lenses with different shapes in front of your eyes to determine which provides the clearest vision. | Most cases of astigmatism respond to the following treatments: | Glasses. This is the simplest and most common option. Glasses for astigmatism contain a specialized toric (cylindrical) lens that provides additional light-bending power along a certain visual axis.
  Contacts. These corrective lenses sit directly on the cornea surface, providing a wider field of vision. Mild to moderate astigmatism can usually be corrected with soft toric lenses. More severe cases may require rigid gas permeable lenses. Your ophthalmologist can help you determine which type is best for you.
  Orthokeratology. This treatment uses specialized rigid contact lenses to gradually correct the curvature of the cornea. At the start of treatment, the lenses are worn for a few hours at a time (usually at night), and then removed. As the shape of the cornea improves, they can be worn less frequently. Orthokeratology is not a permanent fix; if you stop wearing the lenses, your vision issues will return.
  Laser surgery. Several types of surgical procedures can reshape the cornea surface and provide permanent correction of some types of astigmatism. | In almost all cases, astigmatism responds to treatment and won’t keep you from your daily activities. Because your eyes change over time, you may need to update your corrective lens prescription periodically to keep your vision sharp."	"There is no known prevention for astigmatism. However, regular preventative care can detect the problem early and keep your corrective lens prescription up-to-date. | Healthy adults should have eye exams: | Every 2-4 years between ages 40 and 55
  Every 1-3 years from 55-65
  Every 1-2 years after 65
  More frequently if recommended by your physician."	"Astigmatism. American Optometric Association. Retrieved May 21, 2015 from http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/astigmatism.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder	"An estimated 4-12% of children suffer from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a chronic neurological condition characterized by hyperactive, inattentive and/or impulsive behavior. Children with ADHD often face challenges at school and with their friends, and many suffer from other behavioral disorders as well. Signs of ADHD are usually noticeable in children by the age of 7. | There are three main types of ADHD: | Combined type: hyperactive and impulsive behavior with inattention/distractibility. This is the most common form of ADHD.
  Impulsive/hyperactive type: hyperactive and impulsive behavior, without inattention/distractibility. This is the least common form of ADHD.
  Inattentive/distractible type: Inattention and distractibility without hyperactivity. | There is no cure for ADHD. Medication and behavior therapy are used to help patients control symptoms and lead functional lives. Although ADHD is a childhood condition, the symptoms can last into adulthood."	"The exact cause of ADHD is not known but research suggests that genetics is a factor. ADHD symptoms seem to run in families and often affect siblings within the same family. Boys are also more likely to have ADHD. Physiological characteristics of ADHD have been observed in brain images from patients, which show lower metabolism in areas that control attention. | Other ADHD risk factors include: | Family history of ADHD or mental disorder
  Exposure to environmental toxins such as lead
  Risk to fetus when mother smokes, consumes alcohol or is exposed to environmental toxins during pregnancy
  Premature birth or low birth weight
  Brain injury
  Being male. | Currently, there is not enough scientific evidence to link ADHD with excessive dietary sugar, television viewing or particular parenting styles."	"The main symptoms of ADHD are hyperactivity, inattention and impulsiveness. Such behavior is typical of most healthy preschool-aged children. What distinguishes a normal child from one with ADHD is the frequency and severity of symptoms. In an ADHD patient, these symptoms persist for at least six months and interfere with adaptive functioning at home and at school. A child with ADHD typically displays at least 6 of the following symptoms: | Constantly moving (e.g. running, jumping)
  Cannot remain seated
  Fidgeting and/or squirming excessively
  Inability to focus on one task
  Inability to remain quiet
  Forgetfulness. | Short attention span
  Poor listening skills
  Easily distracted
  Forgetfulness
  Cannot get organized
  Inability to focus on details
  Poor academics. | Speaking or acting out of turn in class or during organized activities
  Taking risks without careful thought."	"To diagnose ADHD, a physician will thoroughly evaluate a child’s family history and behavior via interviews and detailed questionnaires. Neurological and psychological testing may also be necessary for an accurate diagnosis. It is easy to mistake a normal child’s active tendencies with those of ADHD. To further complicate matters, the symptoms of ADHD share some overlap with those of other behavioral disorders, some of which may present concurrent with ADHD. A child with ADHD displays at least six symptoms of hyperactivity, inattention and impulsiveness, and is not able to function at home or at school. ADHD is generally diagnosed in children by the age of 7. Diagnosing preschool-age or younger children is difficult and often requires the expertise of other pediatric specialists. | Treatment for ADHD varies depending on the child’s age and symptoms, and involves a combination of medication and behavior therapy. Patients who suffer from depression, anxiety or other disorders may also benefit from regular counseling. | Behavior management by itself cannot correct overall hyperactive, inattentive or impulsive symptoms.  However, in conjunction with medication, it can help control specific symptoms (e.g. helping a child keep their hands to themselves). Behavior therapy is a team effort - it requires the participation of parents, other caregivers and teachers. Examples include: | Behavior therapy. Parents, caregivers and teachers adopt a systematic approach to help the child correct his or her behavior. This can include creating a daily routine for eating/sleeping, using a reward system to reinforce positive behavior and removing privileges to discourage negative behavior. Specialized training is also available to help children develop better social skills.
  Psychotherapy. Talking about daily challenges raises self-awareness in children and helps with symptom management.
  Parental training/family therapy. Specialized training or therapy sessions help parents of children with ADHD avoid personal stress and be more effective caregivers. | The drugs routinely used to treat ADHD are called psychostimulants because they reduce symptoms by stimulating the brain to focus. Depending on the time of day, either short-acting (1-4 hours) or long-acting (8-9 hours) stimulant medication is used. For example, a long-lasting drug allows a child to focus during school hours. Psychostimulant drugs have been used to manage ADHD symptoms for over 50 years, often with great success. Most associated side effects are mild, but it is very important to use the medication as directed. The different types of medications are: | Methylphenidate (Concerta®, Metadate®, Ritalin®)
  Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine®, Dextrostat®)
  Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse®)
  Dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall XR®)
  Atomoxetine (Strattera®; a non-stimulant drug for mood swings)."	Currently there is no way to prevent ADHD. Children and pregnant women (due to the risk to fetus) should avoid exposure to smoke and environmental toxins to reduce risks. Early detection and treatment help children adapt better in school and other social environments.	"“Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)”. National Institutes of Health (NIH).

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder	"Autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are terms for a disability characterized by impaired social skills, impaired speech, and repetitive behaviors. The signs of ASD usually appear in infancy or very early childhood. ASD consists of a spectrum of signs and symptoms, ranging from mild to severe. Some Individuals demonstrate only mild signs of autism and function well, but others persons, with severe forms of ASD, may experience profound debilitation throughout their lives. | ASD is considered a single disorder that encompasses the following autism subtypes once thought to be separate conditions: | Autism (the most severe form of ASD)
  Asperger syndrome (a form of ASD characterized by the same symptoms as autism, except the child’s speech and language skills are well developed)
  Childhood disintegrative disorder (a rare form of ASD characterized by normal early childhood development followed by a late onset of autism symptoms between ages 3 to 10)
  Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or PDD-NOS (mild autism symptoms). | The prevalence of ASD is increasing, and 1 of 68 children has some form of the disorder. ASD is four times more common in males than females."	The cause of ASD is still unknown, and there is no explanation for the increasing incidence of this disorder. Researchers have established that genetic factors are involved. Having a sibling with ASD significantly increases a child’s risk of also having ASD. Having older parents also increases a child’s risk of ASD. Certain medications taken during pregnancy may be linked to the disorder as well.	"The signs of ASD start in infancy or early childhood and continue throughout life. | The predominant sign of ASD is impaired social interaction. Infants and children with ASD do not respond appropriately to other people. Such persons appear withdrawn and are often preoccupied with a single object. | Children with ASD commonly display the following signs and symptoms: | Inability to point at an object of interest by age 1
  Lack of smiling or social interaction
  Not speaking a single word by age 16 months or a two-word phrase by age 2
  Poor eye contact
  Withdrawn appearance
  Failure to respond to their name
  Impaired social skills and problems responding to others
  Impaired language skills and difficulty participating in conversations
  Difficulty understanding nonverbal cues such as body language and facial expressions
  Lack of empathy
  Lack of interest in playing with other children and preferring to be alone
  Repetitive behaviors such as rocking, twirling, biting, or self-injurious behaviors
  Insistence on rigid routines and sameness
  Repeatedly lining up toys in a row
  Intense preoccupation with certain objects
  Abnormal repetition of words or phrases
  Seizures
  Emotional disorders."	"The hallmark findings of ASD are impaired social skills, limited language skills, and behavioral problems. Often, the signs and symptoms are unrecognized and the diagnosis is delayed. Frequently, ASD is mistaken for a hearing problem, because typically these patients do not respond to their name. | When ASD is suspected, a child requires a comprehensive evaluation by experts in human behavior, nervous system conditions, and speech disorders. This team of experts may include a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, and speech therapist. Each of these health care providers performs a special assessment to confirm the diagnosis. | There is no known cure for ASD; however, intensive therapies can significantly improve autism symptoms. The goals of treatment are to reduce or eliminate inappropriate behaviors, increase communication skills, strengthen social skills, and improve functioning in a community. Prompt diagnosis is essential, because early intervention provides better outcomes. | Behavioral interventions may substantially improve autism symptoms. Intensive therapy programs are designed to teach children with ASD a variety of rules, social skills, language skills, and behaviors that will improve their overall functioning.
  Family therapy teaches family members how to properly interact with a child with ASD.
  Medications may be beneficial for specific problems, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, uncontrolled behavioral issues, and seizures."	Ways to prevent ASD are as yet unknown; however, early intervention can substantially improve a child’s behavior. Intensive therapy allows many individuals with ASD to function well in their lives.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/bells-palsy	Bell’s palsy is a temporary facial paralysis that affects movements like smiling and blinking, resulting in a droopy effect. It is caused by nerve damage that interrupts the relay of messages from the brain to the face - usually on just one side of the face. This condition was named after the surgeon who first identified it in the 19th century, Sir Charles Bell. | Each year, roughly 40,000 Americans suffer from Bell’s palsy (usually between the age of 15 and 60). Bell’s palsy is not life threatening and most individuals fully recover by six months, although in rare cases symptoms persist for life.	"Bell’s palsy is caused by inflammation or compression of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which controls the muscles of the face. Infection by a virus is believed to cause swelling and inflammation of the nerve, which in turn restricts the flow of oxygenated blood through the narrow canals (known as the facial or Fallopian canals) holding the nerves on either side of the face near the ears. Numerous viruses from the herpesvirus family are associated with Bell’s palsy. | Bell’s palsy has been associated with the following: | Herpesviruses: Herpes simplex 1 (cold sores), varicella-zoster (chicken pox and shingles), Epstein-Barr (mononucleosis) and cytomegalovirus.
  Other possible viruses: Influenza B (flu), rubella (German measles), adenovirus (respiratory illness), coxsackievirus (hand-foot-mouth disease) and mumps.
  Non-viral: Headaches, chronic ear infection, tumors, diabetes and injury to the face. | "	"Bell’s palsy affects the function of facial muscles, as well as tears, saliva, taste and the middle ear. The condition is often recognized by droopiness on one side of the face, with symptoms that suddenly appear and peak after about one day. The symptoms of Bell’s palsy include: | Sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the face
  Difficulty smiling or closing the eyelid on the affected side
  Jaw or ear pain on the affected side
  Drooling
  Dryness in the eye and mouth
  Ringing in the ear or sensitivity to sound
  Impaired speech or taste
  Difficulty eating and drinking
  Reduced tear production."	"Diagnosing Bell’s palsy starts with a medical examination of the face for signs of paralysis. During a typical exam the patient is asked to perform simple tasks like closing the eyes and smiling. Other tests that evaluate the face for nerve damage or trauma may be performed. | Electromyography (EMG). This test measures how well the facial muscles conduct electrical signals, and determines the presence/extent of nerve damage in the face.
  Imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans provide a detailed image of the face and show physical factors affecting the facial nerves, such as a tumor or an injury.
  Blood test. Blood tests are performed to assess the patient for diabetes or evidence of and infection."	"Treatment for Bell’s palsy depends on the severity of the disease and type of symptoms - many recover without medication. Anti-inflammatory drugs and/or antiviral therapies are commonly indicated, although some studies question the effectiveness of this treatment regimen. Symptoms generally begin to diminish within two weeks, with complete recovery by six months. | Anti-inflammatory drugs. Corticosteroids, like prednisone help reduce nerve inflammation and restore blood flow in the bony canal that holds the affected nerve.
  Anti-viral drugs. Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir (Zovirax®) are prescribed to treat a viral infection, especially in cases of severe facial paralysis.
  Surgery. The bony canals that hold the inflamed nerves can be widened with surgery, but this procedure is no longer common. Plastic surgery may be performed to correct permanent deformity to the affected area of the face.
  Physical therapy. Muscle atrophy affects muscles that are not in use due to paralysis or injury. Regular physical therapy to exercise these muscles helps prevent muscle loss in the affected regions of the face.
  At-home remedies. Over-the-counter pain medications and warm compresses can help relieve inflammation and facial pain. Artificial lubrication and eye covering (e.g. goggles or glasses) help protect the eye when the eyelid cannot fully close. | The best way to prevent Bell’s palsy is by avoiding viral infections and injury to the face. A healthy diet and regular exercise also help prevent other possible risk factors for the disease, such as diabetes."	"“Bell’s Palsy Fact Sheet”.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome	Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when there is pressure and squeezing (entrapment) of an important nerve in the hand called the median nerve. This pressure causes median nerve injury and results in pain, numbness, and weakness in the hand and wrist. | The median nerve and finger flexor tendons pass through a narrow space in the wrist called the carpal tunnel, formed by the carpal bones and enclosed by a fibrous band (transverse carpal ligament or flexor retinaculum). Because the carpal tunnel is very narrow, any irritation of the tendons or any swelling in this space may entrap and compress the median nerve. | Carpal tunnel syndrome tends to occur in adults age 30 to 60 years old and is three times more likely in women than men. This is a very common condition associated with a variety of work-related or medical factors. | With proper treatment, most people completely recover and only a few have permanent nerve damage and loss of hand function.	" | The cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is not completely understood, but the disorder is associated with factors that compress the median nerve and affect the sensory and motor functions of the hand. | Gender and genetic predisposition (women or people with small carpal tunnels)
  Work-related activities that involve repetitive hand motions, especially grasping
  Use of vibrating handheld tools
  Sports involving repetitive hand motions
  Injury to the wrist
  Rheumatoid arthritis
  Pregnancy
  Thyroid disease
  Diabetes | Workers with jobs requiring repetitive use of their hands are more susceptible to carpal tunnel syndrome. Examples include meatpackers, assembly line workers, grocery checkers, garment workers, dental hygienists, and musicians. So far, studies have not proven that excessive use of a computer keyboard or mouse causes carpal tunnel syndrome. In fact, assembly workers are at much higher risk than typists."	Early symptoms include pain and paresthesias (tingling, numbness, and burning sensations) of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger especially at night and after certain activities like driving or holding a book. If the problem worsens, patients experience hand weakness, dropping things, difficulty gripping objects, and clumsiness. Symptoms usually start in the dominant hand, but may be experienced in both hands.	" | It is important to diagnose and treat carpal tunnel syndrome as early as possible to prevent permanent median nerve damage, loss of hand function, and disability. Usually the diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical exam findings indicative of median nerve entrapment, but sometimes nerve testing is necessary. | Decreased feeling in the thumb, index finger, and middle finger.
  Paresthesias reproduced by tapping the wrist over the median nerve (positive Tinel sign) or flexing the wrist for one minute (Phalen maneuver).
  Weakness and wasting of the muscles at the base of the thumb (thenar atrophy) are late findings of chronic nerve injury. | Nerve conduction velocity testing determines how well electrical signals flow through the median nerve.
  Electromyography evaluates the function of nerves and muscles. | Avoidance of activities that trigger symptoms.
  Hand rest for a minimum of two weeks.
  Immobilization with wrist splints.
  Ice packs to reduce swelling. | Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen.
  Corticosteroid injection (a steroid reduces swelling and inflammation).
  Prednisone (an oral steroid). | Physical therapy to restore hand strength.
  Occupational therapy to maintain or improve daily living activities and work skills. | Yoga has been shown to improve strength and relieve pain in carpal tunnel syndrome.
  Acupuncture may improve symptoms in some patients, but more research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness. | Carpel tunnel release surgery is recommended for patients with 6 months of persistent symptoms. This operation involves cutting the transverse carpal ligament at the wrist to provide more space in the carpal tunnel and relieve the pressure on the median nerve. | Open carpal tunnel release is the more traditional approach, which involves making a 2-inch incision in the wrist and cutting the transverse carpal ligament. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release uses two tiny incisions, a small camera, and instruments to cut the transverse carpal ligament. This less invasive procedure shortens the patient’s recovery time. | Both types of surgeries are performed under local anesthesia: medication is injected to numb the tissues and prevent the patient from feeling the surgery, so the patient does not need to be deeply asleep. After surgery, patients need physical therapy to regain hand strength and function, and most patients make a full recovery."	Employers can redesign equipment and adapt activities to fit the human body based on a field of study known as ergonomics. Work areas may be redesigned to allow people to maintain a neutral wrist position while working. Workers are advised to reduce repetitive motions by taking frequent rest breaks, wearing wrist splints, and rotating tasks with other workers. Although there are no studies to prove that these programs prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, they are commonly recommended to prevent workplace injuries.	"Netscher D, Murphy K, Florell N. Ch 70.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/depression	"Depression is a mood disorder characterized by debilitating feelings of sadness and hopelessness that interfere with normal activities of day-to-day life. Depression commonly develops in young adults and adolescents, but the disorder can also occur in children. | Major depressive disorder, also known as major depression, is characterized by profound symptoms of sadness that impair a person’s enjoyment of daily life. The disorder can interfere with work, disrupt sleep, affect appetite, and harm a person’s wellbeing.
  Persistent depressive disorder is a prolonged form of depression that lasts for at least two years.
  Psychotic depression is associated with delusions, hallucinations, and an abnormal sense of reality (psychosis).
  Postpartum depression occurs in certain women after giving birth and is attributed to fluctuations in hormone levels, physical changes, and feelings related to the responsibility of caring for an infant.
  Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that occurs during the winter when there is less sunlight.
  Bipolar disorder (manic depressive illness) occurs when a person has a cyclical disorder characterized by episodes of major depression and episodes of extreme highs (mania)."	A combination of various factors can trigger people to develop depression. Such factors include genetic predisposition, environmental factors, hormones, brain chemicals (neurotransmitters), trauma, relationship problems, and stressful life events (such as divorce or loss of a job). For unknown reasons, women have a much higher risk of developing depression than men. | Studies have shown that certain areas of the brain that shape our mood, memory and behavior can have an altered appearance in those suffering from depression. For instance, some studies have revealed the hippocampus to be physically smaller in people with depression, and suggest that the degree to which it is smaller may correspond to the frequency of symptoms. Whether these physical changes in part lead to depression or are instead an effect of the disorder is still undetermined. | Frequently, people with serious medical problems also have depression. Neurological disorders, thyroid diseases, cancer, infections, and metabolic disorders often lead to depression symptoms. | 	"Common signs and symptoms of depression include the following: | Prolonged sadness
  Hopelessness and pessimism
  Loss of interest in activities and hobbies that were once enjoyable
  Sleep difficulties (insomnia or excessive sleeping)
  Persistent fatigue
  Indecisiveness
  Difficulty concentrating
  Loss of appetite or overeating
  Suicidal thoughts
  Excessive guilt
  Inability to function at work
  Poor hygiene and self care
  Alcohol or substance abuse."	"In some patients, depression is difficult to diagnose because it may mimic other medical conditions. Major depression is often unrecognized in the elderly, for whom the disorder is frequently mistaken for the signs and symptoms of aging. When depression is suspected, a physical examination and lab tests should be performed to rule out a medical illness. | A psychiatric assessment includes a thorough evaluation of a patient’s thoughts and behaviors; history of other psychiatric disorders; current stressors; major life events; occupational history; relationships; family history of mental illness; and use of illicit substances and alcohol. Special attention is given to the presence of thoughts about suicide and signs of poor self-care. | Treatment | Whether patients with depression are treated in a hospital or an outpatient setting depends on the severity of their symptoms and their risk of harming themselves or others. Hospitalization is frequently indicated for patients who are deemed at a high risk of suicide or have extremely impaired self-care. | The choice of antidepressant medication depends on the drug’s side effects and a patient’s response to treatment. Usually patients need 4 to 6 weeks of treatment before a physician can determine whether a specific therapy is effective. Research shows that some patients, especially adolescents, may have an increased risk of developing suicidal thoughts while taking antidepressant medications, so patients need to be carefully monitored after any medication is initiated. | Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) work by affecting the level of serotonin, a brain chemical (neurotransmitter) that is involved in regulating mood. Common SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac®), sertraline (Zoloft®), escitalopram (Lexapro®), paroxetine (Paxil®), and citalopram (Celexa®). These newer medications are popular because they have fewer side effects than older antidepressants.
  Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) work by modifying the levels of neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine. Duloxetine (Cymbalta®) is an example of an SNRI.
  Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs) also alter neurotransmitter levels. NDRIs include bupropion (Wellbutrin®).
  Tricyclic antidepressants are older, rarely used drugs with serious adverse effects.
  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are rarely used medications that are effective for depression but interact adversely with certain foods. | Psychotherapy is also called talk therapy, and for some patients with mild to moderate forms of depression, psychotherapy alone is the initial treatment. A combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy is usually required for patients with moderate to severe forms of depression. | Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps patents modify their negative thought patterns.
  Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on managing troubled relationships that are contributing to depression. | Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) delivers an electrical impulse (shock) to the brain and causes a brief seizure that changes the brain’s chemistry. Prior to an ECT treatment, an anesthetic medication is administered to prevent the patient from feeling the shock sensation. For maximal effectiveness, ECT treatments must be repeated multiple times.
  Bright light therapy is commonly prescribed for seasonal affective disorder. | Patients are advised to engage in regular exercise, which has been shown to significantly reduce depression symptoms. Additionally, proper sleep and diet are recommended. Patients with depression should avoid alcohol and illicit substances. | S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) and St. John’s wort may help reduce mild forms of depression. These over-the-counter treatments are associated with potential risks, and more research is needed to determine their efficacy. | With the patient’s consent, family members are educated about depression and early signs of relapse. Patients with supportive relationships tend to achieve better outcomes."	Although there is no specific method of preventing depression, patients may decrease the risk for major depression by controlling stress and maintaining relationships with family and friends. Individuals with early signs of depression should be treated promptly to prevent severe debilitation.	"What is Depression?

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental illness characterized by recurring unwanted thoughts (obsessions) that produce fear and anxiety. These obsessions trigger repetitive behaviors (compulsions) performed in an attempt to control the obsessions and relieve anxiety. | Typical obsessions include excessive fear of germs or suffering harm. Common compulsions are excessive cleansing and repeatedly checking the same thing over and over. | OCD equally affects males and females. Typically, the disorder starts in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood. Untreated OCD causes disruptive chronic symptoms, which persist for years. However, proper treatment can be very effective in alleviating this condition.	The cause of OCD is unknown. Research suggests that the disorder involves some sort of abnormality in the parts of the brain that control fear and anxiety. OCD runs in certain families, supporting the possibility of a genetic component in this condition. Environmental factors, stress, or infections may also play a role in triggering this disease.	"The most common symptom of OCD is anxiety. Individuals with OCD spend a tremendous amount of time engaged in fearful thoughts and behaviors that interfere with their ability to function at work or school. Overwhelming anxiety and abnormal behaviors eventually harm close personal relationships. | In OCD, a person is plagued by intrusive thoughts, which cause worry, anxiety, and fear. These thoughts will not go away and cannot be controlled. | Obsessions associated with OCD include the following: | Fear of germs, dirt, or infections
  Fear of illness
  Fear of harm to oneself or loved ones
  Driving need for perfection
  Fear of a terrible consequence occurring when some task is left undone
  Recurring thoughts of violence or disturbing sexual acts
  Religious anxieties. | In response to an obsession, a person with OCD is driven to perform certain rituals or repetitive behaviors to guard against a feared situation. Such behaviors are an attempt to briefly dispel anxiety. Most people with OCD find their rituals distressing, senseless, and futile. Nevertheless, they feel unable to stop the behaviors. | Typical compulsions include the following: | Repeated hand washing
  Repeatedly arranging objects to maintain perfect order
  Demonstrating excessive tidiness
  Checking things over and over
  Counting items repeatedly
  Locking and unlocking doors again and again
  Hoarding
  Praying to prevent a feared situation."	"The diagnosis of OCD is generally based on the presence of classic symptoms and behaviors. Although OCD is a mental illness, the evaluation should include a complete physical examination to rule out medical conditions that affect mental capacities. | The goal of treatment is to reduce anxiety and improve a person’s functioning in daily life. Effective treatment for OCD requires a considerable amount of time and cooperation on the part of the patient. | Cognitive-behavioral therapy. Exposure and response prevention is a specific type of cognitive-behavioral therapy used to treat OCD. A person is slowly exposed to the very conditions that trigger fear, anxiety, and compulsive behavior. In a series of treatment sessions, the exposure is repeated until the person develops a new way of thinking and can experience a situation without feeling anxious. For example, individuals who fear germs are instructed to touch items that they consider dirty and not wash their hands. With repeated exposure, the fears gradually decrease to the point that they can touch the objects without becoming anxious.
  Medications. Medications are often used in combination with cognitive behavior therapy. Antidepressant medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly used to treat OCD. Prozac® and Zoloft® are examples of SSRI medications. In certain cases, anti-anxiety medication may also be prescribed."	There are no known methods to prevent OCD. Early treatment is recommended to control the disorder and prevent worsening symptoms.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/shingles	Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The varicella-zoster virus also causes chickenpox. | Overview and Causes | 	"Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The varicella-zoster virus also causes chickenpox. | Chickenpox is an infectious disease mainly seen in childhood, associated with a fever, rash, and skin blisters. After a person recovers from chickenpox and is no longer ill, the body never completely rids itself of the virus. Instead, VZV remains present in an 
    
    
    
  inactive (dormant) state in dorsal root ganglia, the part of the spinal nerves responsible for sensations such as pain. Years after an episode of chickenpox, VZV can become reactivated, causing shingles. Typically, shingles appears as a painful rash along a band of skin (dermatome) supplied by a single nerve root. |  | Most cases of shingles occur in people over the age of 50. Approximately a third of the population in the United States will experience shingles during their lifetime. Shingles is not a life-threatening condition, but it is extremely painful. | Only individuals who have experienced chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine can develop shingles. It is unclear what triggers dormant VZV to reactivate and cause shingles in some people and not in others. Older people and individuals with suppressed immune systems or cancer have a higher risk of developing this condition."	"Shingles usually causes a band of blisters, affecting one side of the trunk or face. Typically, the condition affects one or two thoracic dermatomes and is called localized herpes zoster. However, individuals with weakened immune systems may develop disseminated zoster, a type of shingles that spreads across large areas of the body. | Pain is the primary symptom of herpes zoster. Often, there is excruciating pain described as burning, aching, or stabbing. Other symptoms may include itching, numbness, and tingling of the skin. A few days after the onset of pain, the rash will appear. Next, clear fluid-filled blisters (vesicles) develop along the affected dermatome. Over a period of two to four weeks, the vesicles break open, crust over, and heal, but often the affected skin is left darkened and scarred. | Older individuals and people with a weakened immune system are more likely to experience severe forms of shingles and more complications from the infection. | Complications | Postherpetic neuralgia. Some patients with shingles experience persistent pain after the rash has resolved. This complication is termed postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). The pain associated with PHN may persist for weeks, months or, rarely, years.
  Ophthalmic shingles. When herpes zoster involves the eyes, it may result in permanent vision loss.
  Encephalitis. Inflammation of the brain is a rare but serious complication.
  Bacterial superinfection. The skin becomes infected with bacteria that can spread to deeper tissues, causing serious illness.
  Involvement of other organs. Herpes zoster can rarely involve the liver, lungs, and gastrointestinal system. | Risk of Exposure to Others | The virus associated with shingles is very contagious. Direct contact with active blisters can spread the infection to susceptible people (those who have never experienced chickenpox). When the virus from shingles infects others, it causes chickenpox, not shingles. | After the lesions dry and crust over, there is no longer a risk of spreading the infection to other people. While contagious, a person with shingles should avoid contact with pregnant women, newborns, and people with impaired immune systems, because chickenpox infections may cause serious complications in these individuals."	" | Most cases of shingles are diagnosed by the patient’s symptoms and physical examination, revealing a painful rash with blisters on one side of the body. The diagnosis can be verified by scraping the skin lesions to identify the virus in a laboratory. | Treatments include: | Antiviral medications. These drugs are used to lessen the severity of the infection, shorten the duration of illness, and decrease the risk of postherpetic neuralgia.
  Pain medications. Common medications are gabapentin, a medication for nerve pain; narcotics for severe pain; tricyclic antidepressants, useful for pain as well as for depression; and a topical lidocaine patch (medication applied to numb the surface of the skin)."	The chickenpox vaccine (Varivax®) is given to reduce a person’s chance of experiencing chickenpox. It does not provide a guarantee against developing the infection, but it often lessens the severity of the illness. Children who have received the chickenpox vaccine have a significantly lower risk of developing shingles than people who have experienced a chickenpox infection. | The shingles vaccine (Zostavax®) is recommended for adults over age 60 to prevent reactivation of VZV and shingles. The shingles vaccine is not effective for everyone and some patients develop shingles despite having received the vaccine, but their illness is usually milder with fewer complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope	Have you ever felt nauseous or fainted while having blood drawn, experiencing intense anger, or standing in a hot room? Your reaction was probably due to activation (overstimulation) of the vagus nerves. They’re two large nerves that control your heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure, and other involuntary processes in your body, and they’re very sensitive to your emotions and body sensations. |  | When the vagus nerves are activated due to a stressor, your heart rate slows, your blood pressure drops suddenly, and the blood vessels in your legs dilate (widen). This causes blood to pool in the lower part of your body rather than flowing freely to your brain. This sequence of events is called the vasovagal response, and it can cause you to feel weak, nauseous and even faint. In fact, it’s the most common cause of fainting. When vasovagal response causes fainting, it is called vasovagal syncope. | Vasovagal response is usually harmless. It almost always goes away on its own, and even people who faint wake up almost immediately. However, some people have been injured after fainting suddenly and falling. Vasovagal syncope can also be mistaken for more serious conditions like heart arrhythmia and epilepsy. | Just about everyone experiences vasovagal response now and then. Vasovagal syncope is also very common, affecting up to 25 percent of the population. It’s most often seen in children and teens but can happen at any age.	"Vasovagal response is usually triggered by physical or emotional distress: | Prolonged standing
  Sudden changes in body position (standing quickly after sitting for a long time)
  Being in a hot, crowded or poorly ventilated place
  Sight of blood, having blood drawn
  Intense emotions, including shock, anger, pain, or anxiety
  Straining, such as when lifting something heavy or having a difficult bowel movement. | Recent studies suggest that the tendency toward vasovagal syncope may be inherited. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and pinpoint the genes involved. Interestingly, even in cases where the condition appears to run in families, members have different triggers."	"During a vasovagal response, a person might experience: | Pale skin
  Lightheadedness
  Tunnel vision, blurry vision, or “graying out”
  Nausea
  Feeling too hot
  Cold, clammy sweat
  Yawning. | People who faint due to vasovagal response might give a few jerky muscle movements. (More continuous movements suggest a seizure, which is treated differently.) The pulse is typically slow and weak. Upon waking, the pupils may appear dilated."	"A person experiencing vasovagal response can often avoid fainting by lying on his or her back with the legs elevated. Another option is to sit down and lean the head between the knees. Once the discomfort passes, the person should slowly return to a normal posture. | People who faint due to vasovagal syncope usually wake up quickly. Have the person roll onto the back, elevate the feet above the heart, and encourage the person to stay lying down for 15 to 30 minutes. This allows sufficient time for blood flow to return to normal and helps prevent another fainting episode. | Call 911 if a person who has fainted doesn’t wake within a minute or has difficulty breathing. | A person who has fainted should see a doctor if: | This is a first fainting episode, and there wasn’t an obvious trigger involved.
  Fainting caused a significant injury, such as a fall on the head.
  Additional symptoms are present like shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat or seizures. | After a fainting episode, the doctor’s first goal is usually to rule out any heart and brain conditions that could be causing the problem. Evaluation usually includes: | History and physical exam. The doctor will want to know what happened, including possible triggers.
  Electrocardiogram (EKG). This test records the heart’s electrical activity through the skin. It’s used to detect fast or irregular heart rhythms that can cause fainting. An EKG can be performed in the doctor’s office or over a longer time period using a wearable device called a Holter monitor.
  Echocardiogram. Ultra-high-pitched sound waves are passed through the chest and reflected to visualize the heart in motion. This test can detect issues with valves and blood flow that might cause fainting.
  Exercise stress test. This measures heart activity during exercise, usually with the patient on a treadmill.
  Blood tests. The lab can detect conditions like low blood sugar and anemia (a shortage of healthy red blood cells) that might cause a person to feel weak or faint.
  Tilt table test. The patient lies on a table that leans at various angles while blood pressure and heart rate are monitored. People prone to vasovagal syncope often faint during this test. | Vasovagal response and syncope rarely require medical treatment. However, about one percent of syncope patients have frequent attacks that interfere with their daily activities. For them, options include: | Medication. Drugs used to treat low blood pressure can help reduce episodes.
  Physical therapy. Leg exercises and aids like compression stockings may help to prevent blood from pooling in the legs.
  Diet changes. Increasing sodium (salt) and fluid intake can raise blood pressure and prevent attacks.
  Pacemaker. This device is surgically implanted in the heart and uses electrical signals to prevent the drop in heart rate. | People with vasovagal response almost always recover completely and quickly and have no after-effects."	"The best way to prevent vasovagal response is to avoid or manage common triggers: | Sit or lie down during blood draws.
  Avoid hot, crowded, stuffy areas.
  Drink plenty of fluids.
  If standing or sitting for a long time, tense your leg muscles to help keep blood moving."	"Fainting (2014). The Nemours Foundation. Retrieved Nov. 9, 2015, from http://kidshealth.org/teen/your_body/health_basics/fainting.html.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/viral-meningitis	Viral meningitis is the most common form of meningitis, which is inflammation of the tissue that lines the brain and spinal cord. Other causes of meningitis include bacteria, fungi and non-pathogenic triggers of inflammation. The initial phase of the disease is marked by flu-like symptoms, such as fever and body ache. As the disease progresses, characteristic symptoms of headache and stiff neck develop. Most healthy individuals show no symptoms or recover over a few weeks without medical intervention. However, infants and patients with compromised immunity are at greater risk of severe illness. The bacterial form of meningitis is a more serious disease and carries the risk for complications, including brain damage and death.	"Viral meningitis is caused by a variety of viruses, including enteroviruses, herpesviruses, arboviruses (West Nile virus), measles virus, mumps virus, influenza virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The two common causes of viral meningitis in the United States are the following. | Enteroviruses: Enteroviruses (e.g., echovirus and coxsackievirus) are the main cause of meningitis in the United States. These viruses live in the digestive tract and reach peak infection numbers during late summer and early fall. Enteroviruses commonly infect children and transmit easily by the hands and mouth through infected droplets.
  Herpesviruses: Herpesviruses (e.g., herpes simplex viruses and varicella zoster virus) commonly cause meningitis in adolescence and adults. These viruses transmit via contact with infected sores and blisters on the skin. Meningitis is typically associated with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a sexually transmitted virus that causes genital blisters. | The route of transmission varies depending on the virus. | Blood: Direct contact with open skin on an infected person allows transmission through blood. This is the most common means of transmission.
  Air: Inhaling infected droplet in the air allows some viruses to infect new hosts.
  Stool/vomit: Enteroviruses transmit via contact with vomit or stool from an infected person. Rapid transmission occurs in public swimming pools, childcare centers and other crowded places.
  Sexual intercourse: Herpesviruses transmit via direct contact with open sores on the genital of an infected person.
  Mosquito: West Nile virus and other arboviruses transmit through an intermediate host, such as a mosquito. Humans become infected after getting bitten by the insect.
  Rodents: The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus spreads via urine, stool or saliva from infected rodents (e.g., pet mice or hamster). Infected droplets can contaminate water, food or dust, which transmit virus when ingested. | Risk factors for viral meningitis include the following: | Age: Children younger than age five are at increased risk of viral meningitis. Infants younger than one month old can develop severe meningitis.
  Poor immunity: Children or adults with a weak immune system due to disease or certain treatments are at greater risk of viral meningitis."	"The early symptoms of viral meningitis mimic common flu symptoms. As the inflammation worsens, headache and neck stiffness develop. Some people do not experience any symptoms. | Symptoms in babies: | High fever
  Irritability
  Sleepiness
  Poor appetite
  Bulge on the soft spot on the head (fontanel)
  Stiff neck or body. | Symptoms in those over the age 2: | Headache
  Nausea and vomiting
  Stiff neck
  High fever
  Confusion
  Sleepiness
  Lack of appetite
  Light sensitivity."	Meningitis is initially diagnosed based on the symptoms, specifically the headache and stiff neck symptoms. Follow-up laboratory testing of naso-oropharyngeal swabs, rectal swabs, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and serum allow for an accurate diagnosis. Imaging techniques (e.g., computerized tomography or magnetic resonance) help detect inflammation in the head and neck region. | Timely diagnosis and treatment of meningitis, in particular bacterial meningitis, is critical; delayed treatment can result in severe complications, including brain damage, hearing loss, impaired memory/learning, seizures and even death. The bacterial form of meningitis requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. There are no known drugs for treating the common viral causes of meningitis; in most cases, patients improve with bed rest and proper intake of fluids. Over-the-counter medication is used to alleviate some of the associated symptoms.	Routine vaccination according the guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the best way to prevent meningitis caused by some viruses (e.g., measles and mumps virus). There is no vaccine against enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis. Routine handwashing and avoiding contact with sick individuals is the best way to prevent viral meningitis.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/chlamydia	Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection and the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States with 2.8 million new cases annually. It affects both men and women and can spread via oral, vaginal or rectal intercourse. An infection may not always produce symptoms, which is why routine screening for chlamydia is recommended for at-risk sexually active men and women. | Chlamydia is easily treated with antibiotics. However, it can lead to serious reproductive health problems if left untreated. Pregnant women carry the risk of passing on the infection to their newborn.	Chlamydia trachomatis is the species of bacteria that causes chlamydia. The route of transmission is through unprotected sexual contact (oral, vaginal and rectal) with an infected individual. The risk of infection is higher in individuals who are under the age of 25; engage in unprotected sexual contact; have multiple sexual partners; and/or have a prior history of STDs. | 	"The symptoms of chlamydia are often mild and therefore hard to notice. Symptoms may become noticeable 1-3 weeks following infection and include: | Unusual discharge from the vagina or penis
  Pain during sexual intercourse in women
  Bleeding following sexual intercourse in women
  Pain and swelling in the testicles
  Pain and burning during urination
  Pain in the lower abdomen
  Rectal pain and bleeding (if the rectum is infected)."	"Laboratory tests that detect the chlamydia bacteria are the best way to diagnose the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends routine screening for pregnant women and women under the age of 25 who are sexually active. | Swab test. A swab of cervical discharge in women or the urethra in men is cultured and tested for the presence of the chlamydia bacteria. In some instances the sample is collected from the anus.
  Urine test. This test looks for evidence of bacteria in the urine and does not require a pelvic swab.
  STD home test. To find out quickly and discreetly whether you have chlamydia, consider at-home chlamydia test kits that test for it as well as other common STDs. Remember to share the results with your healthcare provider. | Chlamydia can be treated and fully cured with antibiotics such as azithromycin or doxycycline. The infection is cleared within 1-2 weeks of starting treatment, during which time it is important to abstain from sexual activity in order to prevent disease transmission. If left untreated, chlamydia can spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes in women and cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - a serious condition that can result in permanent scarring and infertility. In men, the infection can spread to the epididymis and prostate gland, causing pain and fever. Infected women who are pregnant may pass the disease to their newborn during childbirth."	The best way to prevent chlamydia is by practicing abstinence or maintaining a monogamous sexual relationship with a non-infected partner. Correct use of condoms during both vaginal and rectal intercourse helps reduce the risk of contracting chlamydia and other STDs. All sexually active women under the age of 25 should seek routine screening for early detection and treatment of chlamydia. Pregnant women receive routine screening for chlamydia as part of prenatal testing. Individuals with a previous history of chlamydia can become reinfected and should continue to practice these preventative measures.	"“Chlamydia”.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/epididymitis	The epididymis is a long, tightly coiled tube located behind each testicle that connects the testicle to the ductus deferens and stores sperm. | Acute epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, causing pain and swelling of the scrotum. Most cases are caused by sexually transmitted bacterial infections occurring in men age 19 to 35 years old. | Chronic epididymitis refers to inflammation characterized by persistent testicular pain in the absence of scrotal swelling. This condition is usually more difficult to treat and may result in long-term pain.	 | Epididymitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection that starts in the urethra, bladder, or prostate and ultimately spreads to the epididymis. Depending on the patient’s age, the most common causes of epididymitis are sexually transmitted infection, an enlarged prostate gland, or urinary tract infections. | In heterosexual men under age 35, acute epididymitis is most often caused by a sexually transmitted infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea. These bacteria frequently cause serious infections of the genitals and reproductive systems of men and women. Men who practice anal intercourse may develop epididymitis caused by enteric bacteria found in the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as E. coli. Unprotected sexual intercourse or sexual intercourse with multiple partners increases the risk of these infections. | In men over age 35, the most common cause of acute epididymitis is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This condition, known as benign prostatic hypertrophy, obstructs the normal flow of urine from the bladder and causes urinary tract infections, which may later spread to the epididymis. | Less commonly, epididymitis occurs in children. In pediatric patients, epididymitis is usually related to a urinary tract infection, congenital abnormality of the genitourinary system, or the presence of foreskin on an uncircumcised penis. | Other factors increasing the risk of epididymitis include urinary tract surgeries, use of a urinary catheter for bladder drainage, or medical conditions causing suppression of the immune system, such as HIV. Uncommonly, a noninfectious type of epididymitis is the consequence of testicular trauma or use of a heart medication called amiodarone. | Major complications of acute epididymitis include chronic epididymitis, infertility, and testicular abscess. Chronic epididymitis is an outcome of inadequately treated acute epididymitis or recurrent infection. Some patients experience chronic epididymitis after vasectomy, a procedure to cut the ductus deferens as permanent birth control for men.	Patients with acute epididymitis usually complain of one-sided testicular pain, tenderness, and scrotal swelling. Other symptoms may include a cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis, frequent urination, and burning with urination. | Chronic epididymitis is distinguished by the presence of pain for longer than 6 weeks and the absence of swelling.	" | In acute epididymitis, the physical examination shows tenderness and swelling of the scrotum, discharge from the penis, enlarged groin lymph nodes, and fever. | Discharge from the urethra is checked for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other infectious organisms. The fluid is also examined under a microscope to detect an elevation of white blood cells, a sign of infection in the urethra. If you want to test discreetly, you can also look into STD home tests, which check for gonorrhea, chlamydia and other STIs.
  Urine specimens are tested for a urinary tract infection.
  Blood tests may show an elevated white blood cell count indicative of infection.
  An ultrasound might be performed to check for other scrotal conditions like testicular torsion, abscess, or tumor. | The goals are to cure the infection, prevent transmission of the infection to others, and prevent infertility or chronic pain. Treatment includes the following: | Antibiotics are started immediately without waiting for the laboratory test results. When chlamydia or gonorrhea is the likely cause, patients are treated with two antibiotics: ceftriaxone as a single intramuscular injection and doxycycline given orally for 10 days. Men who have sex with men and engage in insertive anal intercourse are treated with an additional antibiotic to treat enteric organisms found in feces.
  Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen.
  Bed rest.
  Elevation of the scrotum.
  Prevention of transmission of infection to others.
  Evaluation and treatment of sexual partners. | Usually, chronic epididymitis is more difficult to treat and may require 4 to 6 weeks of antibiotics. Unfortunately, some patients experience persistent pain for many years. As a last resort, doctors may consider surgery to remove the epididymis (epididymectomy)."	Sexually active individuals can decrease their risk of sexually transmitted infections by using condoms for intercourse and having sex with only one partner at a time. | Anyone with urethral discharge, scrotal swelling or testicular pain should refrain from sexual activity and seek immediate medical treatment to prevent transmission of the infection to others and avoid long-term complications.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction	Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a sexual disorder where a man is not able to get or maintain an erection for sexual intercourse. An estimated 30 million men in the United States are affected by ED, also referred to as “impotence.” Although the risk of ED increases with age, the natural process of aging is not the cause. | The process of forming an erection begins when a man experiences sensory or mental stimulation, which sends signals from the brain to nerves in the penis. These impulses relax local muscles, allowing a rush of blood that expands the penis to a full erection. A normal erection lasts until after sexual climax, when local muscles contract to stop blood inflow. Loss of function at any of these steps can lead to ED. | ED can cause social/emotional anxiety and have a negative impact on intimacy. Additionally, it poses a challenge for partners trying to become pregnant. It is critical to discuss ED with a physician in case it is a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as heart disease and diabetes.  Depending on the cause, a variety of treatment options are available.	"ED is caused by a range of emotional, psychological and physical conditions that affect the normal process of achieving an erection. In some instances, multiple factors are involved. Physical conditions can cause ED by damaging the nerves, muscles, arteries and fibrous tissues involved in an erection, while psychological/emotional factors interfere with the initial sensory stage of arousal. Sometimes the anxiety associated with ED exacerbates the condition. | Diseases of the heart and blood vessels
  High blood pressure
  Plaque buildup in the arteries (atherosclerosis)
  Diabetes
  High cholesterol
  Kidney disease
  Nervous system disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis)
  Scar tissue formation in the penis (Peyronie’s disease)
  Low levels of male hormone testosterone (which you can check at home using a testosterone test) | Stress
  Anxiety
  Depression
  Lows self-esteem. | Age: Although age is associated with ED (over 50% of men with ED are age 60 or older), the process of aging is not a factor.
  Medical conditions: Diseases of the nervous system, kidneys and heart are linked to ED.
  Medications: Drugs used to treat depression, allergies, ulcers and high blood pressure increase the risk of ED.
  Smoking: Tobacco use reduces the body’s overall blood flow and can lead to ED.
  Injury: Prostate cancer treatments and other trauma to the penis, pelvis and spinal cord can cause ED.
  Sports: Activities that restrict blood flow to the penis (e.g., bicycling) are associated with ED.
  Obesity: High body weight increases the likelihood of a variety of other medical condition, including ED.
  Drugs/alcohol: Prolonged use of alcohol and drugs increases the risk of ED.
  Psychological disorders: Stress, depression and other mental disorders typically have a negative effect on arousal."	"The symptoms of ED include: | Difficulty having and/or maintaining an erection
  Low sexual desire."	"Physicians diagnose ED by performing a physical exam and questioning the patient about their symptoms. The following tests may be performed to identify the cause of ED: | Blood/urine tests: These tests measure proteins associated with testosterone, diabetes, heart disease and other health conditions.
  Physical exam: A physical exam of the penis and testicles looks for signs of nerve damage or physical injury.
  Ultrasound: This technique uses sound waves to produce an image of the veins carrying blood to the penis.
  Erection test: This test keeps track of the number and strength of erections men experience during nighttime sleep.
  Psychological evaluation: This exam uses a series of questions to identify anxiety, depression and other psychological causes of ED. | Lifestyle changed can often remedy ED and restore sexual function back to normal. These include avoiding tobacco, drugs and alcohol, and improving physical fitness. Additionally, receiving proper therapy for anxiety, depression and other psychological triggers of ED is important. | If ED is the result of a health condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, then therapy is focused on treating those conditions. Patients who develop ED due to prescription medication can talk to their doctors about alternative medications. Therapies specifically targeting ED include drugs, pumps and surgery (as a last resort). | Oral drugs: Oral drugs like sildenafil (Viagra®) and tadalafil (Cialis®) help men get an erection by enhancing blood flow to the penis. These drugs cannot cause an erection automatically; the initial sexual stimulation is still required.
  Injectable/suppository: The drug alprostadil also acts by improving blood flow to the penis. It can be delivered via injection to the base or side of the penis. Alternatively, it can be delivered via a small suppository applicator through the penile urethra.
  Hormone therapy: Hormone replacement therapy is used in men who develop ED as a result of low levels of the male hormone, testosterone.
  Pumps: Hand- or battery-powered pumps force blood to the penis by vacuum action. Once placed over the penis, the pump draws out the air from inside the tube, leaving a vacuum that draws blood into the penis. A tension ring at the base of the penis holds the blood in the penis to maintain the erection.
  Implants: Inflatable or semirigid rods are surgically placed along both sides of the penis to allow manual control of an erection.
  Surgery: ED caused by leaking or obstructed blood vessels is treated by surgical techniques, such as vascular stenting or bypass."	Regular exercise and mental health welfare are effective ways of preventing the lifestyle causes of ED. It is also important to limit alcohol and avoid drugs and tobacco.	"“Erectile dysfunction”.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/hpv	Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of related viruses that infect human epithelial cells. Epithelial cells line body surfaces like the skin, throat, female reproductive tract and anus. They are avascular, meaning they receive nourishment through neighboring cells rather than the blood vessels. | Viruses, including HPV, are primitive microorganisms that reproduce by injecting their genetic information into healthy cells. The infected cells reproduce rapidly, replicating the viruses’ DNA. Usually, the body’s immune system detects and destroys these infected cells. Occasionally this doesn’t happen, and the infection becomes chronic, or long-term. | There are more than 100 different strains, or types, of HPV. About 40 specifically affect the genital area, including the vagina, vulva, penis, anus, cervix, rectum and scrotum. Genital forms of the disease are sexually transmitted. | HPV is probably best known for causing warts, including genital warts. Most warts are harmless, but they can cause irritation and embarrassment. Skin-to-skin contact with warts can spread the HPV virus to others. |  | A few strains of HPV have the ability to cause cancer. These are known as “high-risk” strains. HPV infection is responsible for about 5 percent of all cancers. | Cancer occurs when an HPV infection causes cell abnormalities. Usually these abnormal cells die off. However, long-term infection can lead to more severe, persistent cell changes that develop into precancerous lesions and eventually cancer. Cancer is a condition in which uncontrolled cell growth causes tumors to form and spread through the body. | Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV, with two strains (16 and 18) responsible for 70 percent of all cases. (The cervix is the passage between the vagina and uterus). HPV also causes about 85 percent of anal cancers and about half of all vulva, vagina, penis and upper-respiratory cancers. After the initial infection, HPV-related cancer can take up to 20 years to develop. | The genital form of HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. About half of men and 75 percent of women will be infected with HPV at some point in their lives. Each year, about 360,000 people are diagnosed with genital warts and 10,000 women get cervical cancer.	HPV usually enters the body through small tear in the skin during skin-to-skin contact. Most people with the virus have no symptoms and don’t know they’re infected. However, they can still spread the virus to others. | Sexually transmitted forms of HPV spread through genital-to-genital contact with an infected person’s vagina, penis or anus. The virus can also be spread by mouth-to-genital contact, though this is less common. | In rare cases, HPV can spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth.	"Most people with HPV do not know they are infected and never develop symptoms or health problems. Symptoms like warts, genital warts or cell abnormalities may develop many years after the initial infection. | HPV causes many kinds of skin warts, including: | Common warts - rough warts on the hands and fingers
  Plantar warts - hard, grainy warts on the soles of the feet
  Flat warts - small, raised warts that appear on many parts of the body. | Genital warts may occur alone or in groups. They come in a variety of sizes and textures and may be flat, stem-like or cauliflower-shaped in appearance. | Cellular changes caused by HPV, including precancerous lesions, usually have no outward symptoms and can only be detected by a laboratory test."	A physician usually diagnoses genital warts simply by looking at them. In some cases, when infection is suspected, the doctor applies a weak vinegar solution to the skin in the genital area. This causes HPV-related lesions to turn white and helps detect flat lesions that are difficult to see. | Several tests can help detect and prevent cervical cancer in women. During the Pap test, the doctor scrapes a small clump of cells from the cervix and sends them to the laboratory for analysis. This test detects precancerous cellular changes caused by HPV infection. | DNA testing can now detect high-risk HPV strains in the cervix before they cause cellular changes. It’s usually performed in conjunction with a Pap test in women over 30 or in women who have an abnormal or inconclusive Pap test. | Another modern convenience is the ability to order and use a home HPV test. As the name suggests, you don’t even have to leave your house, and results are 99.9% accurate. | You can also learn more about broader STD home test kits, which allow you to test for HPV and numerous other STDs conveniently at home. | There is no treatment for the HPV virus itself. Warts, including genital warts, can often be removed with topical medications, chemical treatments and surgical techniques. It’s important to remember that wart removal does not remove HPV from the skin and that the virus can still be transmitted to others. | When detected in time, precancerous lesions caused by HPV can be surgically removed before they develop into cancer. Options include surgical removal and destruction by laser, electricity or freezing. | Even without treatment, most HPV infections clear up on their own within one to two years, and most don’t cause health problems. Chronic (long-term) infection with a high-risk strain increases the risk of cancer, especially in people whose immune systems are weakened by certain medications or by infection with HIV/AIDS. Still, less than 50 percent of high-grade (large, advanced) lesions develop into cancer.	"HPV is such a common virus that it’s difficult to avoid altogether. However, the following steps can help reduce your risk: | Don’t pick at existing warts or bite your nails.
  Keep feet clean and dry, and wear sandals in locker rooms, pools and public showers.
  If you are female, get regular cervical cancer screenings as recommended by your doctor.
  Use latex condoms every time you have sex. Condoms won’t prevent all HPV infections, but research suggests they do provide some protection.
  Use a barrier method like a dental dam during mouth-to-female-genital contact. | Two effective vaccines are available against certain strains of HPV: | Gardisil protects against several HPV-related cancers and genital warts and can be given to both men and women.
  Cervarix protects women against cervical cancer. | Vaccination is routinely given to children ages 11-12. If you’re concerned about HPV and weren’t vaccinated as a child, ask your doctor about your vaccination options."

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/mastitis	Breastfeeding has many benefits for babies, including improved nutrition and protection from childhood diseases. It even reduces the risk of diabetes later in life. Unfortunately, an infection called mastitis can interrupt breastfeeding or cause the mother to abandon it altogether. |  | Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast characterized by pain, redness, and swelling. It can happen to any woman but is most common in those who are breastfeeding - especially within the first three months after a baby’s birth. It’s a very common condition that affects about one in 10 breastfeeding mothers in the United States. | Mastitis usually isn’t dangerous. But if it’s not treated quickly, it can cause an abscess (pocket of pus) to form inside the breast that may require surgical treatment. In rare cases, breast abscesses can be fatal, though almost all of these deaths occur in developing countries. In HIV-positive mothers, mastitis may increase the risk of spreading the disease to the baby. | The most common problem caused by mastitis is interruption or cessation of breastfeeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life. However, the pain and exhaustion caused by mastitis may cause a mother to wean her baby before she planned to do so.	"There are two major causes of mastitis. They often occur together: | Milk stasis. This happens when a breast doesn’t empty completely during feedings. When milk is left to stagnate inside the ducts of the breast, it can lead to inflammation and increase the risk of infection.
  Bacterial infection. Bacteria from the mother’s skin or baby’s mouth can enter the breast through either the milk duct or a crack in the skin around the nipple. (Fortunately, these germs aren’t harmful to the baby.) | Risk factors for developing mastitis include: | Sore or cracked nipples.
  Using only one breastfeeding position, which may prevent the breast from draining completely.
  Poor “attachment” of the infant at the breast. If a baby doesn’t grasp the nipple firmly with its mouth, it will have a hard time drawing milk out of the breast. Nursing a poorly attached baby can also irritate the nipples, increasing mastitis risk.
  Feeding more often on one breast. This happens often, because many babies attach more easily to one side.
  Missed or decreased frequency of feedings and milk expression.
  Wearing a tight-fitting bra.
  Being tired and run down.
  Multiple birth (twins or triplets).
  Having a personal history of mastitis."	"Women who are coming down with mastitis often experience flu-like symptoms for a few hours before noticing any breast discomfort: | Fever of 101 degrees or greater, chills
  Feeling tired and run down. | Breast symptoms appear later and usually affect only one side: | Pain, swelling, and warmth of the breast tissue
  Pain or burning sensation (may be most noticeable while feeding)
  Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern."	"Women who experience mastitis symptoms should see a doctor right away. Early treatment can limit discomfort, minimize interruptions to breastfeeding and prevent complications. | Both obstetricians and primary care providers diagnose and treat mastitis. The mother may also be referred to a lactation consultant for breastfeeding advice and support. | Mastitis is usually diagnosed on history and physical exam. Sometimes a sample of the breast milk is cultured to determine which organism (germ) is causing the disease. The doctor will also rule out other causes of breast soreness, including: | Abnormalities in the baby’s mouth (cleft palate, short frenulum)
  Nipple fissure
  Blocked milk ducts
  Yeast infection of the breast. | Treatment for mastitis include: | Oral antibiotics.
  Antibiotic creams (to be applied to the breast skin).
  Over-the-counter pain relievers like Tylenol, Advil, or Motrin IB.
  Adjustments to breastfeeding technique that help to prevent milk stasis. These might include more frequent feedings, changing positions, and improving the baby’s attachment.
  Rest and fluids.
  Emotional support. Mastitis can be frustrating, can cause anxiety, and can make a woman feel very sick. | Mothers with mastitis should continue breastfeeding (or if that’s not possible, pumping or hand expressing their milk). Moving fresh milk through the breast will help clear out the infection. Applying warm compresses or showering beforehand can help to empty the infected breast and promote healing. | Women with mastitis should see a doctor again if their symptoms don’t improve within a few days. In these cases, the doctor may want to rule out inflammatory breast cancer, a rare cancer that has symptoms similar to mastitis. This is usually done by a mammogram (imaging test) and tissue biopsy (minor surgery). | With proper treatment and support, almost all women recover from mastitis and are able to continue breastfeeding. During and after recovery, it’s important to make sure the breast is emptied regularly to prevent the condition from recurring."	"Good breastfeeding technique helps to prevent mastitis. Some tips for mothers include: | Drain one breast completely before switching to the other.
  If the baby doesn’t finish the second breast, start on that one next time.
  Change positions from time to time.
  Make sure the baby latches on correctly.
  If you have difficulties, consider working with a lactation consultant."	"Diseases and Conditions: Mastitis (July 2012). Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research. Retrieved May 22, 2015 from http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mastitis/basics/definition/con-20026633.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/menorrhagia	Menorrhagia is defined as heavy periods, or excessive uterine bleeding, lasting over seven days. The classic definition for menorrhagia is the loss of greater than 80 mL of blood per cycle, but this metric is no longer used in the clinic due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate measurements from patients. Instead, physicians use the frequency of tampon change to diagnose the disease. This condition disrupts routine activities and can be very emotionally stressful for the women involved. | The most common complication associated with menorrhagia is anemia - a lower than normal red blood cell count, which leaves the body feeling weak and tired. In some cases women also experience severe menstrual cramps that require medical intervention. | Menorrhagia is treatable with drugs or surgical therapies that include a hysterectomy (complete removal of the uterus). The choice of treatment depends on the symptoms, patient’s age, other health factors and intent to have children. Menorrhagia affects 30% of reproductive-age women in the United States. 30% of hysterectomies performed before the age of 60 are due to menorrhagia. | 	"The exact cause of menorrhagia is not known, but an imbalance in the amounts of female hormones progesterone and estrogen plays an important role. The following are known causes and risk factors for menorrhagia: | Hormonal imbalance. The hormones estrogen and progesterone regulate the menstrual cycle in women and are responsible for thickening of the innermost uterine lining (endometrium). Shedding of this lining results in the bleeding associated with a period. An imbalance in the levels of estrogen and progesterone can lead to excessive thickening of the endometrium and heavier bleeding as it sheds. Dysfunctional ovaries can cause such an imbalance by inhibiting the production of progesterone.
  Age. Girls in their first year of menstruation and women approaching menopause (ages 40-50) are most likely to have irregular menstrual cycles without ovulation (releasing an egg). This directly reduces the amount of progesterone hormone and causes heavy bleeding during menstruation.
  Uterine tumors. Benign growths in the uterus such as polyps and fibroids, which appear in woman of reproductive age, can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Uterine, ovarian and cervical cancers also pose a small risk for developing menorrhagia.
  Pregnancy complications. A miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy (where the fertilized egg implants in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus) can also cause menorrhagia.
  Intrauterine device (IUD). An IUD is a small contraceptive device that is inserted into the uterus. Heavy uterine bleeding is a known side effect of IUDs.
  Bleeding disorders. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) or platelet function disorders are inherited conditions where specific proteins required for blood clotting are absent, hence the higher risk of menorrhagia.
  Other disorders. Pelvic inflammatory disease; liver, kidney, or thyroid disease; and endometriosis and adenomyoses (different conditions involving the ectopic growth of endometrial tissue) may increase the risk of menorrhagia.
  Medication. Anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant drugs pose the risk of heavy and/or prolonged periods."	"The following symptoms may be indicative of menorrhagia. | Saturating multiple sanitary pads or tampons per hour
  Requiring two sanitary pads to contain uterine bleeding
  Waking up at night to change sanitary pads or tampons
  Prolonged bleeding that lasts beyond a week
  Passing large blood clots
  Inability to engage in routine daily activities
  Fatigue and weakness (signs of anemia)."	"The phrase “heavy bleeding” is open to interpretation by patients and is not a reliable metric for diagnosing menorrhagia. Most women with this condition experience bleeding that lasts more than 7 days (4-5 days is typical), and lose greater than 2-3 tablespoons of blood. The need to change sanitary protection almost every hour is a key diagnostic sign of menorrhagia. Other tests used to diagnose menorrhagia include: | Blood test. Blood tests are performed to look for iron deficiency (a symptom of anemia), and other conditions associated with menorrhagia, such as thyroid disease and disorders affecting blood clotting.
  Pap test. During a pap exam, cells from the cervix are collected and tested for signs of infection, inflammation and cancer.
  Endometrial biopsy. Tissue sample from the endometrial lining is collected and tested for signs of inflammation, cancer and other abnormalities. This procedure causes some pain and discomfort similar to a menstrual cramp.
  Imaging. An ultrasound test uses sound waves to produce an image of the uterus, pelvis and ovaries, and can help physicians detect physical abnormalities. In a related procedure called sonohysterography, a liquid is injected in the uterus prior to performing an ultrasound. The injected liquid allows a more detailed visualization of the uterine wall, in comparison to a regular ultrasound.
  Hysteroscopy. This exam allows direct visualization of the uterus via a tiny camera that is inserted through the vagina and cervix. | Treatment | A range of treatments are available to lessen the symptoms of menorrhagia or cure it. The choice depends on the patient’s age, medical history, ideal outcome and future plans to have children. Surgery is generally reserved for patients who do not respond to drug therapies. | Hormone therapy. Oral contraceptive pills, hormonal IUDs and hormone (estrogen & progesterone) pills can reduce bleeding by restoring the proper balance of hormones and making periods more regular.
  Other drugs. Iron supplements can address the iron deficiency associated with anemia. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can alleviate menstrual cramps and reduce blood loss. Drugs that help clot blood or prevent clot breakdown are available for patients with blood-clotting disorders.
  Fibroid removal. Heavy bleeding caused by fibroids can be treated by shrinking the fibroids. Uterine artery embolization cuts off the blood supply to fibroids, while focused ultrasound ablation destroys fibroid tissue using sound waves; both procedures help reduce the size of problematic fibroids. Uterine fibroids can also be surgically removed using a procedure called myomectomy, which is performed either via small incisions in the stomach or by directing surgical tools through the vagina and cervix.
  Endometrial removal. Removing, or thinning, the endometrial lining can help reduce heavy bleeding in women with menorrhagia. In endometrial ablation the tissue is destroyed, while in endometrial resection tissue is physically removed. Women who undergo these procedures are advised against becoming pregnant.
  Dilation and Curettage (D&C). This procedure reduces menstrual bleeding by removing tissue from the uterine lining. First, the cervix is dilated (opened) and then tools are inserted to scrape or suction the tissue. Multiple D&C treatments may be necessary if menorrhagia symptoms reoccur.
  Hysterectomy. Women who continue to suffer from symptoms of menorrhagia and do not wish to become pregnant may consider a hysterectomy, which is the complete removal of the uterus. Following a hysterectomy a woman stops having menstrual cycles and can no longer become pregnant. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia and requires hospitalization."	Currently there is no way to prevent most causes of menorrhagia. The likelihood of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, which is a known risk factor for menorrhagia, can be lowered by avoiding unsafe sexual intercourse and other activities that cause infection.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/vaginitis	"Vaginitis is a general term for inflammation of the vagina. Vaginitis is a common condition often caused by infections, which may be sexually transmitted but not always. There are various noninfectious types of vaginitis as well. | Different types of vaginitis are difficult to distinguish based on symptoms alone. Physicians diagnose vaginitis by performing laboratory tests of vaginal fluid and prescribe treatments based on the patient’s type of vaginitis. | Vaginitis most commonly results from one of the following conditions: | Bacterial vaginosis
  Trichomoniasis
  Yeast infection
  Atrophic vaginitis (also called vaginal atrophy) |  | Most cases of vaginitis are curable, and complications are usually avoided when patients receive timely treatment."	"Bacterial vaginosis (BV), an overgrowth of vaginal bacteria, is the most common cause of vaginitis. Beneficial bacteria (primarily lactobacilli) normally live in the vagina in greater numbers than harmful bacteria. When harmful bacteria outnumber lactobacilli, the imbalance causes inflammation. The exact cause of bacterial vaginosis is unknown; however, sexual activity, intrauterine devices for birth control, and douching increase a woman’s chance of developing bacterial vaginosis.
  Trichomoniasis (“trich”) is a highly contagious sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite (Trichomonas vaginalis), which affects both women and men. Multiple sex partners and unprotected sexual intercourse increase the risk of infection. An STD home test can check for trichomoniasis infection from the convenience of home.
  Yeast infection is caused by an overgrowth of a fungus (usually Candida albicans). Yeast is normally present in the vagina in small numbers, but tends to overgrow in certain conditions, such as diabetes, weak immune system function, pregnancy, antibiotic usage, and steroid usage. Damp or tight clothing contributes to yeast infections by creating a dark, moist environment that promotes yeast growth. | Atrophic vaginitis, caused by menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries, is the result of a reduced level of the hormone estrogen and thinning of the vaginal lining, which makes the vagina susceptible to inflammation, irritation, and burning.
  Scented soaps, tampons, spermicides, and detergents may cause allergic reactions.
  Vaginal douches can disrupt the balance of normal vaginal organisms and irritate vaginal tissues."	Normal vaginal fluid is white and odorless. Patients with vaginitis may develop abnormal vaginal discharge, irritation, itching, and odor. Although various types of vaginitis cannot be distinguished based on symptoms alone, there are classic characteristics associated with each form. | Patients with bacterial vaginosis may experience a thin, white or gray vaginal discharge with a foul fishy odor. Vaginal itching and irritation are rare and some women have no symptoms at all. | Most women and men with trichomoniasis (70%) experience no symptoms at all. Such individuals are unaware of their infection, but they still may infect others through sexual activity. Symptomatic women experience mild to severe inflammation, itching, burning, vaginal odor, and a profuse greenish yellow vaginal discharge. Men may notice irritation of the penis, burning with urination, or penile discharge. | Yeast infections often cause severe vaginal itching, burning, irritation, painful urination, and pain with sexual intercourse. Sometimes, there is a thick white vaginal discharge resembling cottage cheese.	" | The types of vaginitis are difficult to distinguish on the basis of symptoms, so patient should undergo a pelvic examination by a health care provider. A pelvic examination consists of an inspection of the vagina and cervix and sampling of vaginal secretions for examination under a microscope. | Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed when an examination of vaginal fluid detects the absence of lactobacilli bacteria and the presence of clumps of bacteria with abnormal cells called “clue cells.” This infection is treated with antibiotics: metronidazole, clindamycin, or tinidazole. Male sex partners do not need treatment.
  Trichomoniasis results in redness and swelling of the vulva and vagina. The diagnosis is confirmed by examination of vaginal fluid for the presence of Trichomonas organisms. Treatment consists of a single dose of an antibiotic (metronidazole or tinidazole) and the infection is usually readily cured. Sex partners must also be treated or reinfection is likely.
  A yeast infection is diagnosed by an examination of vaginal fluid for the presence of yeast cells. Yeast infections may be treated with over-the-counter antifungal creams such as miconazole, clotrimazole, or tioconazole. Yeast infections are difficult to diagnose based on symptoms alone, so patients should visit a heath care provider before using these treatments. Often a prescription antifungal medication such as fluconazole is required. Sex partners do not require treatment.
  Atrophic vaginitis is treated with vaginal moisturizers, lubricants, or estrogen medication. There is a concern that estrogen therapy can increase the risk of breast cancer.
  Other noninfectious types of vaginitis resolve with avoidance of irritating products. | Complications | Bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis increase the risk of developing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, so timely treatment is essential.
  During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis increase the risk of premature deliveries.
  Patients with HIV can develop severe, persistent yeast infections, which are unresponsive to treatment."	The use of latex condoms reduces the risk of sexually transmitted infections; therefore, women can reduce their risk of vaginitis by using latex condoms for sexual intercourse and having only one sex partner at a time. | The risk of vaginitis is also decreased when women avoid douches, irritants, or tight clothing.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/asthma	Asthma is a chronic condition wherein the airways that deliver air to the lungs become swollen and narrowed. Certain substances in the environment act as “triggers” for increased inflammation and mucus production that further restrict airflow, causing shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. | Asthma affects people at any age and can lead to minor symptoms or life-threatening attacks. Although there is no cure, individuals with asthma can treat their symptoms with medication and lead normal lives. Seven million children and over 18 million adults live with asthma in the United States.	"The exact cause of asthma is not yet understood; however, various environmental and genetic factors are known to play a role. Asthma triggers can lead to symptoms (mild or severe) in those who already have the disease, and they include: | Airborne allergens (e.g. pollen and dander)
  Respiratory infections
  Air pollution
  Sulfites and food preservatives
  Certain medications (e.g. beta blockers and aspirin)
  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
  Cold air
  Physical activity
  Emotional stress. | Asthma risk factors increase a person’s likelihood of developing the disease, and they include: | A family history of asthma
  Smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke (including in utero)
  Certain allergies (e.g. hay fever)
  Respiratory infections, especially during infancy
  Inhaling air pollution or aerosolized chemicals (e.g. hairspray)
  Obesity. | "	"The following symptoms are associated with an “asthma episode” or “asthma attack”, and may require immediate medical attention: | Frequent coughing, especially at night, during sleep, and early morning
  A whistling or “wheezing” sound when breathing
  Chest tightness
  Shortness of breath."	"In order to diagnose asthma, a doctor first conducts a physical exam and inquires about the family history of asthma and other known risk factors. Next, various tests are performed to assess the flow of air into the lungs. The following are the main diagnostic tests for asthma: | Lung function. Spirometry and peak flow tests measure the amount, rate, and force of exhaled air. This information allows physicians to estimate the extent of narrowing in the airways, as well as patient response to treatment. Improved lung function following medication (e.g. albuterol) or decreased lung function following a clinical trigger (e.g. methacholine) are positive indication of asthma.
  Allergy testing. This test helps identify the allergens that cause an asthma attack and allows for designing the right treatment plan.
  Imaging. A visual inspection of the lungs and sinuses using X-ray and high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scan helps detect infections or other abnormalities.
  Stress and cold testing. Modified lung function tests that include physical activity or cold inhaled air allow for diagnosis of asthmas that are triggered by these factors. | Sometimes a diagnosis of asthma is actually incorrect, when the correct diagnosis would be a genetic disorder called A1AD (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency); it develops gradually and can present similarly to asthma. Learn about how DNA health testing can help determine if there’s a genetically higher risk that you’re actually suffering from A1AD. | Asthma treatment requires a lifetime commitment and depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms. Long-term treatments aim to prevent severe asthma attacks, while quick-relief treatments control sudden flare-ups. Treatments are generally delivered via hand-held inhalers or nebulizers that produce a fine mist. | Long-term drugs. Inhaled corticosteroids prevent inflammation inside the airways, thereby reducing sensitivity to environmental asthma triggers. Other drugs that work by controlling inflammation are leukotriene modifiers and cromolyn. Theophylline and long-acting beta2-agonists prevent chest tightness by relaxing the muscles that surround the airways. Beta2-agonists are usually administered with corticosteroids as a combination inhaler. Omalizumab is an antibody therapy that helps control allergy-linked asthma.
  Quick-relief drugs. In instances of a sudden asthma attack, short-acting beta2-agonists quickly alleviate symptoms by opening up the airways. Ipratropium and corticosteroid therapies are used to dilate the airways (bronchodilator) and reduce inflammation, respectively.
  Other remedies. Allergy-induced asthma is treated with antihistamines or other immunotherapies that reduce the body’s immune response to allergens. Keeping the home environment free of known allergens is also advisable."	Although asthma the disease cannot be prevented, asthma attacks can be prevented by taking the required medications and avoiding known triggers. Getting the pneumonia and seasonal flu vaccines also help avoid asthma-related complications. Reducing exposure to cigarette smoke, air pollutants, and harmful aerosolized chemicals, especially during infancy, can lower the risk of developing asthma later in life.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/atelectasis	Atelectasis is a condition where some or all of the air-filled sacs (alveoli) inside the lungs collapse, thereby reducing the lungs’ capacity to deliver oxygen to the body. Alveoli are surrounded by small capillaries that exchange carbon dioxide with oxygen from inhaled air. This oxygenated blood is then carried to the brain and other organs via the circulatory system. A coating of surfactant liquid inside the alveoli walls normally ensures they remain inflated for efficient gas exchange. However, mucus buildup, respiratory illness and surgery can hinder this process, causing atelectasis. |  | In minor form, atelectasis may not produce noticeable symptoms. Adults with atelectasis generally recover quickly using respiratory exercises that re-inflate the affected alveoli. Persistent atelectasis can lead to infection of the lungs (pneumonia) and requires timely treatment, especially in infants, small children and adults with existing respiratory illness. | In obstructive atelectasis, alveoli become collapsed due to a physical blockage of airflow. Non-obstructive atelectasis is the term used when alveoli collapse due to factors acting via other mechanisms.	"Conditions that hinder deep breathing and coughing cause atelectasis. | Mucus buildup: Surgery and some respiratory conditions prevent the lungs from efficiently clearing fluids. Anesthesia drugs given during surgery disrupt the body’s normal breathing patterns, causing secretions to collect in the airways. Additionally, the pain following surgery of the chest/abdomen reduces the urge to cough and take deep breaths, exacerbating the problem. Such a “mucus plug” is also associated with cystic fibrosis and asthma attacks.
  Infection: Chronic fungal, bacterial and other infections of the lungs can leave behind scars that affect airflow.
  Foreign object: Accidental inhaling of small items (e.g., nuts and small toys) can block airflow to the lungs.
  Tumor: An abnormal growth inside the lungs can impede airflow and collapse the alveoli.
  Blood clot: Excessive bleeding inside the lungs can form obstructive clots. | Trauma: Pain resulting from injury to the chest area can make it difficult to inhale and cough.
  Pleural effusion: Accumulation of fluid in the space outside the lungs but inside the chest cavity (pleural space) can press on the airways, causing collapse.
  Pneumothorax: Certain lung procedures or injuries to the chest cause air to leak into pleural space. This buildup of pressure exerts force and collapses the lungs.
  Tumor: Large tumors within the vicinity of the lungs can push and deflate the alveoli. | General anesthesia
  Lung or chest surgery
  Lung or chest injury
  Lung infection
  Premature birth
  Children under the age of three and adults over age 60
  Neuromuscular diseases that impair deep breathing
  Lung diseases such as asthma, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis
  Being on a ventilator."	"Mild atelectasis with only a few collapsed alveoli may not produce symptoms. However, symptoms develop quickly when larger areas of the lungs are affected. The symptoms of atelectasis include: | Difficulty breathing
  Rapid breathing
  Chest pain
  Coughing."	"Atelectasis is routinely diagnosed using a chest X-ray to visualize the lungs and surrounding areas. This imaging technique can identify most physical obstructions inside the airways, or factors exerting pressure on the lungs. Other techniques used to inspect the airways include: | Computed tomography (CT): A CT scan produces images that are more detailed than a routine X-ray.
  Bronchoscopy: In this procedure, a lighted camera on a thin tube is guided down the bronchi, the main passageways that deliver air to the left and right lobes of the lungs. It allows for visualizing, and sometimes removing, physical obstructions. | Minor atelectasis does not require medical intervention and can subside on its own. Treatment for more severe disease is focused on re-expanding the alveoli and addressing the underlying cause, as described below: | Surgery: Atelectasis following surgery is treated by deep breathing and coughing exercises. Movement and changing positions in the hospital bed also facilitate recovery. Devices that increase the air pressure inside the lungs may also be used.
  External pressure: Atelectasis caused by external pressure from a tumor or fluid is addressed by removing the tumor, or suctioning/draining the fluid.
  Blockage: A physical obstruction of the airway can be removed surgically or via bronchoscopy. A mucus plug is loosened using medication or chest percussions.
  Illness: Infections and other lung disorders are treated with appropriate therapies."	The risk of developing atelectasis can be reduced with persistent deep breathing and coughing following anesthesia or lung/chest surgery. In children, it is important to use age-appropriate toys without small parts.	"“Atelectasis”. Mayo Clinic.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/legionnaires-disease	Legionnaires’ disease is a lung infection (pneumonia) that is caused by the Legionella pneumophila (commonly referred to as Legionella) bacterium. It is named after the first recorded outbreak at the 1976 American Legions Convention in Philadelphia, which led to 34 deaths. Legionnaires’ disease is contracted by inhalation and not transmitted from person to person. The bacteria live in warm water and soil, but can also thrive inside poorly sanitized water systems. Water sprays, air conditioning units, spas and other equipment that produce a fine mist can spread the bacteria and contaminate breathable air. |  | Legionnaires’ disease is fairly common in the United States and is linked to 8,000 - 18,000 hospitalizations each year. The majority of those contracting the disease do not become ill, while others require hospitalization and antibiotic treatment. Life-threatening pneumonia may develop in smokers, those with weakened immunity and other high-risk individuals. Similar to other types of pneumonia, Legionnaires’ disease has a 15% chance of death. The Legionella bacterium is also responsible for a milder flu-like disease called Pontiac fever, which does not affect the lungs and clears without treatment.	"Legionnaires’ disease is caused when Legionella bacteria enters the lungs through microscopic water droplets. Transmission usually happens though the nose (inhalation), and less often, the oral cavity (aspiration) - for example, when coughing reroutes some ingested fluid down the respiratory tract. | Legionella is found in soil and natural bodies of water, but in such low levels that there is little risk to humans. Water systems (in particular heated systems) that are not properly cleaned can harbor high levels of Legionella. When contaminated water is vaporized, sprayed or forced out through vents, it produces small droplets that can be inhaled. Water systems that can harbor and transmit Legionella include: | Hot tubs
  Cooling towers
  Hot water tanks
  Domestic plumbing
  Air conditioning units
  Public pools and decorative water features. | The body’s immune system can clear Legionella with little or no symptoms. However, roughly 5% of those who become exposed develop severe illness. The risk factors include: | Smoking. The most important risk factor for Legionnaires’ disease is smoking. Long-term smoke inhalation (which can also be through second-hand smoking and other sources) damages the bronchioles of the lung making it difficult to clear the bacteria.
  Weak immunity. Diseases (e.g. HIV/AIDS, cancer) and immunosuppressive medication (e.g. for organ transplant recipients) weaken the immune system and increase the risk of developing Legionnaires’ disease.
  Chronic lung disease. Emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer and other chronic lung diseases are high risk factors for Legionnaires’ disease.
  Age. People over the age of 50 are at increased risk."	"Symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease begin anytime between two days to two weeks after exposure and are similar to those associated with other pneumonias.
Early symptoms include: | Low-grade fever
  Headache
  Joint and muscle pain
  Fatigue
  Poor appetite. | Late symptoms include: | High fever (up to 104°F)
  Coughing up mucus
  Difficulty breathing
  Chest pain
  Vomiting
  Abdominal pain."	"Legionnaires’ disease is diagnosed by evaluating the lungs for pneumonia and confirming the Legionella infection. | X-ray. An X-ray image of the chest cavity allows doctors to assess the presence and severity of pneumonia in the lungs.
  Urine test. This test detects antigen (or a protein) that belongs to the Legionella bacteria.
  Culture. As an alternate method for confirming infection, the Legionella bacteria can be acquired from sputum or lung biopsy and grown in the laboratory.
  Blood test. Elevated levels of circulating antibodies in the blood are a non-specific indication of an existing infection. | Legionnaires’ disease is treated with antibiotics and often requires hospitalization. Early treatment helps prevent serious complications, including death."	Proper cleaning and disinfecting of pools, hot tubs, and other water systems that can harbor Legionella is the most effective way of preventing transmission. Avoiding smoking reduces the lung’s susceptibility to all pneumonias, including Legionnaires’ disease.	"“Legionella”. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/measles	"Measles, also known as rubeola, is a serious childhood disease that is caused by a highly contagious virus. The common symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red watery eyes and a signature red body rash. There is no cure for measles and most people successfully clear the disease over the course of a few weeks. Children younger than age 5 and adults older than age 20 are at increased risk of developing serious measles-associated complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain). | Ear infection: affects 10% of children with measles and can cause hearing loss
  Diarrhea: occurs in less than 10% of patients with measles and can be severe
  Bronchitis/laryngitis/croup: an inflammation of the voice box (larynx) and airways
  Low platelets: a drop in the blood cells involved in clotting is seen in some patients
  Pregnancy: measles can cause loss of pregnancy or premature birth
  Pneumonia: affects 1 in 20 children with measles and is the common cause of death in this group
  Encephalitis: affects 1 in 1000 children with measles and can lead to swelling of the brain tissues, vomiting, convolutions, permanent intellectual disability and death
  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE): A rare and deadly disease of the central nervous system that can affect patients up to a decade after they develop measles. |  | Prior to 1963 when the measles vaccine was developed, measles affected most children before they reached the age of 15. At the time, there were a total of 3-4 million infections per year in the United States, resulting in up to 500 deaths annually. Following widespread vaccination in the 1980s, the rate of new measles infections dropped by 80%, followed by an additional decline once the two-dose recommendation for the vaccine was implemented in 1989. Currently, there are an average of 60 reported measles infections in the United States each year. Despite the fact that the majority of children worldwide are now receiving the measles vaccine, the disease continues to be a leading cause of death in small children. In 2013, there were a reported 145,700 global deaths due to measles, the majority of which were in developing countries."	"The measles virus is present in the nose and throat of an infected person. It spreads through sneezing, coughing, talking and other activities that cause infected droplets from these cavities to become airborne. A person becomes infected by directly inhaling the infected droplets, which remain infectious for several hours. Alternatively, the hands can pick up the live virus from an infected surface and transmit them via contact with the eyes, nose and mouth. The measles virus is extremely contagious; 90% of those who come in close proximity to an infected person are expected to become infected. A person with measles can transmit the virus starting at four days before the rash develops, until four days after the rash has begun. | Unvaccinated children under the age of 5 are at highest risk for measles and its potentially fatal complications. The known risk factors for measles are: | Lack of immunity: Newborns and young children who are not vaccinated against measles are at highest risk of being infected. Children and adults who are vaccinated but do not develop immunity are also susceptible. The risk is especially high in developing countries due to poor access to vaccines.
  International travel: Unvaccinated individuals can become infected by travelling to developing countries where measles is more prevalent.
  Pregnancy: Pregnant women who are not vaccinated can become infected with potentially fatal consequences to the fetus.
  Vitamin A deficiency: Deficiency in vitamin A increases the chances of contracting measles."	"The symptoms of measles appear after a 10-14 day incubation period, during which time no symptoms are present. The initial stage of measles begins with a high fever that can last up to a week, followed by cough, runny nose, red/watery eyes and white spots inside the mouth. After 3-5 days, the second stage begins with a red rash that starts on the face and neck and spreads over the rest of the body. The rash looks like small raised red bumps and generally lasts about a week before gradually fading. The full list of symptoms includes: | High fever
  Cough and sore throat
  Runny nose
  Red watery eyes (conjunctivitis)
  Tiny white spot inside the mouth
  Red body rash that coincides with a spike in fever (104° Fahrenheit)."	"Measles is diagnosed by its signature rash, as well as the white spots inside the mouth. If needed, laboratory test are also available to identify the measles virus. There is no cure or specific treatment for measles. However, there are ways to manage the risks of developing serious complications. | Post-exposure vaccine: Receiving the measles vaccine 72 hours after exposure to the virus may help in prevention, or lead to a milder form of the disease.
  Immune serum globulin: Injection of antibodies in pregnant women, infants or those with weakened immunity may help prevent measles, or lessen disease severity.
  Fever reducer: Over-the-counter fever reducers can be used to manage fever symptoms in children.
  Antibiotics: Antibiotics are prescribed to treat secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia or an ear infection.
  Vitamin A supplement: Vitamin A supplementation can help reduce measles symptoms and deaths in patients with nutritional deficiency."	The recommended course of the measles vaccine is the best line of defense against the disease. The vaccine, which is called the MMR vaccine, combines three diseases (measles, mumps, and rubella) and is administered in two doses during childhood. Anyone who develops measles must remain in isolation in order the prevent transmission to high-risk populations, such as infants, pregnant women and those with weakened immunity.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/parvovirus	Parvovirus infection, also known as fifth disease or slapped-cheek disease, is a common childhood illness caused by the human parvovirus B19 virus. It is a highly contagious infection that is spread from person to person, with peak transmission during the winter and spring months. It begins with typical cold symptoms followed by a signature rash on the face, hence the name slapped-cheek disease. Parvovirus infection is one of five most common rash-producing infections during childhood, which is the reason it is also referred to as fifth disease; infection in adults is less common. |  | Healthy individuals clear parvovirus without treatment. The most serious complication associated with parvovirus is anemia, which is characterized by a lower than normal red blood cell count. Infection in those with compromised immune systems (e.g. HIV, organ transplant and cancer patients) may lead to severe anemia and hospitalization. Pregnant women with parvovirus infection can trigger anemia in their unborn child, with the risk miscarriage or stillbirth.	Parvovirus infection is caused by the human parvovirus B19. It is transmitted in nasal/oral secretion droplets that are passed between humans through coughing and sneezing. An infected person is considered contagious when he or she shows cold-like symptoms; there is little risk of transmission once the signature rash appears several days later. Preschool- and school-aged children are most likely to contract the virus, especially during the winter and spring seasons. Pregnant women can pass on the virus to their baby via blood.	"In children, parvovirus infection causes early cold-like symptoms, followed by a rash on the cheeks (like slapped cheeks), which may spread to the other parts of the body. The rash appears raised and may feel itchy. The most common symptom in adults is joint pain in the hands, wrists, knees and ankles. Symptoms include: | Early cold symptoms (runny nose, fever, headache)
  Rash on cheeks, arms, legs, buttocks and core
  Itchiness of skin areas with rash
  Joint pain and swelling."	In most cases, parvovirus infection is diagnosed based on the rash symptom. Specific blood tests me be used to detect the virus or to address the specific risks associated with pregnant or anemic patients. | Parvovirus infection is not treated with medicine and clears over several weeks. Itchiness at the site of rash or joint pain may be alleviated with over the counter medication. Patients with weakened immune systems (cancer, AIDS and organ transplant patients) may receive intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to increase their overall antibody levels. Patients with anemia may benefit from blood infusions to restore blood counts. Many pregnant women have natural immunity to parvovirus infection, while others develop mild disease with little risk to the fetus. Prevention is the best course of action for pregnant women who are not immune to infection. If parvovirus infection is confirmed during pregnancy, the fetus is monitored closely for signs of anemia via sonogram and blood tests. There is less than a 5% chance of miscarriage associated with severe fetal anemia.	Hand-washing and limited contact with sick individuals is the best way to prevent parvovirus infection. Currently there is no vaccine, but once people recover from parvovirus, they acquire natural, life-long immunity.	"“Fifth disease”. Medline Plus.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/pneumonia	Pneumonia is a lung infection that causes inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli). This infection is commonly caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or mycoplasma. The severity of illness can range from mild to extremely severe. |  | Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. The risk of pneumonia is increased in children younger than 2, adults older than 65, people with chronic illnesses, and those with weak immune systems.	"Pneumonia is classified by the way patients acquire the infection and the specific organisms involved. | Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) develops outside of a hospital or health care facility.
  Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or nosocomial pneumonia, develops within 48 hours after a hospitalization. The use of a mechanical ventilator is the main risk factor for the development of HAP. The germs associated with HAP are often resistant to antibiotics, and the mortality rate for HAP is high.
  Health care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) originates at any type of health care facility, including a nursing home or outpatient clinic. The germs associated with HCAP also tend to be resistant to antibiotics and associated with a high mortality rate.
  Aspiration pneumonia occurs when patients accidentally inhale their own vomit, saliva, food, or liquids. This condition usually occurs when something impairs the normal gag reflex. For example, people with an altered level of consciousness, brain injury, intoxication, or swallowing difficulty have a high risk of aspiration. |  | The following organisms most commonly cause pneumonia: | Bacteria. In adults, bacteria (including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae) are the most common cause of pneumonia.
  Viruses. Viruses are the most common cause of pneumonia in children younger that 5. Such viruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and influenza A virus. In adults, the most common causes of viral pneumonia include Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV. Usually, viral pneumonia causes less serious illness than bacterial pneumonia. However, pneumonia related to influenza is often serious or life threatening, especially in patients with lung disease or heart conditions.
  Mycoplasma. Certain organisms called mycoplasma are similar to bacteria. Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes a mild case of pneumonia, called “walking pneumonia,” and usually occurs in older children and adults younger than 40.
  Fungi. Bird droppings and soil contain fungi that can cause pneumonia when the organisms are inhaled. People with weak immune systems are more susceptible to this form of pneumonia. | Pneumonia is more common in people with the following risk factors: | Age younger than 2 years or older than 65
  Asthma
  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  Heart disease
  Diabetes
  Mechanical ventilation
  Smoking
  Immunocompromised conditions (such as HIV, cancer, organ transplantation, chemotherapy usage, steroid usage)."	"The most common symptoms of pneumonia include: | Cough
  Thick mucus (phlegm)
  Shortness of breath
  Fever
  Chest pain
  Muscle aches
  Rapid heart rate
  Confusion. | Immunocompromised patients and individuals with certain chronic diseases have a higher risk of developing complications with pneumonia, including: | Difficulty breathing that requires mechanical ventilation (respiratory failure)
  Spread of bacteria into the blood (bacteremia)
  Formation of a pocket of pus in the lung (lung abscess)
  Accumulation of infected fluid in the lining around the lung (pleural effusion)."	"In patients with pneumonia, a lung examination with a stethoscope may reveal abnormal lung sounds, such as wheezes and crackles. When the symptoms and physical examination suggest pneumonia, X-rays and blood tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis. | Chest X-ray provides an image of the infected lung area (infiltrate).
  Blood cultures detect the presence of bacteria in the blood.
  Sputum is examined with a microscope to determine the type of infection.
  Pulse oximetry measures the blood oxygen saturation level.
  Pleural fluid samples are examined for evidence of infection.
  Bronchoscopy is performed by placing a thin flexible camera through the throat into the lungs to examine the airways and obtain samples of respiratory secretions.
  Chest computerized tomography (CT) provides detailed images of the tissues. | Treatment | Patients may be treated on an outpatient basis or hospitalized. After a patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, the clinician’s decision whether to hospitalize the patient depends on the patient’s age, other medical problems, type of pneumonia, severity of illness, and risk of complications. | Bacterial pneumonia is treated with antibiotics, which are started as soon as possible. Most patients improve after 1 to 3 days of treatment.
  Viral pneumonia cannot be treated with antibiotics; instead, antiviral medication is required. Symptoms of viral pneumonia usually improve in 1 to 3 weeks.
  Mycoplasma pneumonia is treated with antibiotics. Most patients have a mild illness and do not require hospitalization.
  Fungal pneumonia is treated with antifungal medications. Immunocompromised patients are more likely to develop this infection, and the risk of complications is high."	In cases of HAP and HCAP, the hands of health care personnel often spread the organisms to patients. Hand washing and other good hygiene practices must be performed to prevent pneumonia and other infections. Similarly, medical devices and respiratory equipment should be properly cleaned and disinfected. | The pneumococcal vaccine prevents pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vaccinations against influenza (flu) and Haemophilus influenzae type B prevent other forms of pneumonia. | Smokers develop pneumonia more often than nonsmokers. Physicians strongly recommend discontinuation of smoking to lower the risk of pneumonia as well as other related chronic diseases.	"Donowitz GR. Chapter 64. Acute Pneumonia.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/scarlet-fever	Scarlet fever, also called scarlatina, is a bacterial infection caused by the Streptococcus bacteria (group A strep, or GAS) - the same bacteria that causes strep throat. It is generally accompanied by a sore throat, a high fever and a signature red rash that is rough to the touch and covers the body. It affects a small fraction of people who already have strep throat. In rare cases, the disease affects individuals with a streptococcal skin infection. Scarlet fever is most common in children between the ages of 5 and 12, but it can affect people of all ages. Timely treatment with antibiotics allows quicker recovery, reduces spread to others, and lowers the risk of developing rare, but serious, long-term complications.	 | Scarlet fever is caused by Streptococcus (group A strep) bacteria, which causes strep throat. When the bacteria release toxins in the body, the characteristic red rash results. The bacteria primarily spread when an infected person sneezes or coughs, and passes the bacteria through liquid droplets in their nose or mouth. Infected droplets on the surface of shared dishes and utensils may also cause transmission. Touching the open sores on the skin of a person with streptococcal skin infection can also transmit the bacteria. | Following exposure, it takes 2-4 days until the onset of symptoms. The biggest risk factor for scarlet fever is being infected with the Streptococcus bacteria. Children are at highest risk, especially in community settings such as schools and childcare centers.	"The first symptoms of scarlet fever are a high fever and sore throat. After 1-2 days, a red rash that mimics a sunburn and feels rough like sandpaper develops on the body. It may start on the face, neck, underarms or groin areas before spreading to the rest of the body. The rash slowly fades over the course of a week. The full list of symptoms include: | A high fever of 101° F or more
  A red, sore throat
  A red rash that feels rough to the touch
  A bright red color on the armpits, groin or elbows
  A red tongue (strawberry tongue)
  A flushed face with a pale ring around the mouth
  A white coat over the tongue or throat
  Swollen glands
  Headache
  Body ache and chills
  Nausea and vomiting
  Difficulty swallowing (due to sore throat)."	" | Doctors diagnose scarlet fever by doing a physical exam and looking at the back of the throat. To confirm strep throat, a throat swab culture test is performed to look for the Streptococcus bacteria. This is essential for matching the infection with the right treatment. | Scarlet fever is treated with a course of antibiotics that kill the bacteria. The infection clears up within days while the rash fades over the course of weeks. As the rash fades, peeling can occur around the fingers, toes and groin areas. If left untreated, scarlet fever is a risk factor for serious long-term health complications, including: | Liver damage
  Pneumonia
  Meningitis
  Ear and sinus infection
  Kidney disease
  Bone and joint pain"	The best way to prevent scarlet fever is by frequent handwashing and avoiding contact with infected individuals.	"“Scarlet fever”. MedlinePlus, NIH. Retrieved Aug 17, 2015. http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000974.htm.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/acne	Acne is a skin disorder that causes a variety of blemishes on the skin, including blackheads, whiteheads, pimples, nodules, and cysts. | Each hair on the human body grows upward through the skin and exits through a tiny opening called a follicle, or pore. The follicles also secrete sebum, an oil that acts as the skin’s natural “moisturizer.” Sebum is created by tiny glands within the skin that empty directly into the follicles. | Acne begins when hair follicles become clogged with excess sebum, dead skin cells and/or bacteria. Bumps develop on the skin surface as these waste products build up in the clogged follicle. In some cases, the blemish becomes infected, causing redness and tenderness. | Acne can affect any part of the skin but is most common in areas with lots of oil glands like the face, chest, back, neck, upper arms, shoulders and buttocks. | Left untreated, acne can cause significant scarring, especially if deeper cysts and nodules are present. As the blemishes heal, they may leave behind a discolored patch that lingers for months or years. Chronic (long-term) acne can also cause significant emotional distress, including low self-esteem and depression. | Acne is the most common skin disorder in the United States, affecting some 80 percent of preteens and teenagers. It also appears to be impacting more and more adults, though the reasons for this increase aren’t clear. Women are more likely than men to suffer from acne, as are people with a family history of the condition. | 	"Any condition that causes the skin to produce excess oil can trigger an outbreak of acne. Oil not only clogs pores, but also causes dead skin cells within those pores to stick together and makes them more difficult for the skin to excrete. The clogged pores create a favorable environment for certain bacteria that naturally live on the skin. | Possible acne triggers include: | Hormones, especially sex hormones called androgens that stimulate sebum production. Hormonal changes associated with puberty, menstruation, pregnancy and hormonal birth control methods can trigger acne outbreaks. Some women tend to break out 2-7 days before a menstrual period.
  Medications, including corticosteroids and lithium.
  Oil from cosmetics, sunscreens or the work environment (for example, cooking oil).
  Pressure from tight clothing, hats, sports equipment or holding a phone against the face.
  Irritation to the skin caused by scrubbing, harsh cleansers or environmental pollutants.
  Sun, an acne trigger for some people.
  Stress, which can cause the sebaceous glands to make more sebum."	"Acne causes several kinds of skin blemishes. | Comedones are slightly raised, skin-colored bumps around the opening of a hair follicle. The trapped sebum inside may be open to the air (a blackhead) or closed (a whitehead). Comedones are considered a mild form of acne and aren’t likely to leave scars. | When bacteria invades a clogged follicle, it can cause redness, swelling, and pain. These “inflammatory” blemishes are more likely to cause scarring or discoloration. Types include: | Papule - a small, red, raised bump around a hair follicle.
  Pustule (pimple) - a red bump with a white pus “head” at its tip.
  Nodule - an infection or blockage deep within the hair follicle that causes a solid, closed lump under the skin.
  Cyst - a painful, closed lump under the skin that’s filled with pus. Like a nodule, it’s caused by an infection or blockage deep within the follicle."	"Mild acne can often be treated at home using over-the-counter remedies containing benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and similar chemicals. These treatments come in many forms, including creams, gels, cleansers, pads and sprays. They may cause mild skin irritation at first, which should go away after a few days of use. It’s often necessary to use an acne product for up to eight weeks before seeing an improvement. | Moderate and severe acne is usually treated by a skin specialist called a dermatologist, who can examine the blemishes and recommend a course of treatment. This often involves a combination of the following: | Prescription-strength topical and oral medications that fight acne by killing bacteria or reducing sebum production.
  Antibiotics to help reduce redness and swelling.
  Oral contraceptives (birth control pills), which can sometimes help control hormone-related outbreaks in women. | For large cysts that don’t respond to other treatments, a drug called isotretinoin may be prescribed. This treatment reduces the size of the oil glands and is very effective, resulting in permanent improvement in about 85 percent of people with severe acne. However, it is also riskier because it can cause potentially severe side effects, including liver problems and severe depression. Due to the risk to the fetus, women must avoid becoming pregnant during and immediately after treatment. Therapy usually lasts 4-5 months. Patients should follow up regularly with their dermatologists during this time. | While taking acne medication, you may notice some mild skin irritation, which should go away after a few days of use. You may also need to avoid the sun and tanning beds, because many medications make your skin more sensitive to UV radiation (the invisible energy waves that cause tanning and sunburn). | Some skin treatments are used in conjunction with medication therapy to control acne and treat scarring: | Laser and light therapy can temporarily disrupt oil production and reduce the amount of bacteria on the skin. Some types are also used to reduce scarring.
  Cosmetic procedures like chemical peels and microdermabrasion can help to manage acne and treat scarring.
  Soft-tissue filler (fat, collagen) can be injected into scarred areas to smooth them temporarily.
  When severe cysts are present, the dermatologist can sometimes drain them with a needle or inject them with antibiotics to stop the underlying infection. | The good news is that almost every case of acne can be effectively managed, though the benefits of treatment may take 4-8 weeks to appear. Some people may need to continue treatment long-term to prevent new outbreaks. Many people who experience acne as preteens and teens eventually “grow out” of the condition."	"To help prevent acne outbreaks: | Wash your skin twice a day with a gentle, alcohol-free cleanser and rinse with lukewarm water. The best way to apply products is with your fingertips. Never scrub your face, as the resulting irritation can make acne worse.
  After you’ve been sweating, take a shower. Perspiration can clog pores.
  Wash your hair frequently, especially if you tend to develop acne around your forehead or hairline.
  Use cosmetics and sunscreens labeled “oil free,” “water-based,” or “noncomedogenic.” Powder-based cosmetics are less likely to aggravate acne than creams. When feasible, remove all of your makeup before sleep.
  Try not to touch your face with your hands or other objects such as phones.
  Avoid touching, squeezing or picking at acne blemishes.
  Wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing. Limit use of hats, backpacks, and sports equipment with tight straps.
  Protect yourself from sun exposure and avoid tanning beds."	"“Acne.” American Academy of Dermatology, 2014. http://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/diseases-and-treatments/a—d/acne. Accessed July 6, 2014.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis	Eczema is a catchall word for a number of skin conditions that cause a very itchy, red rash. | The most common form of eczema is atopic dermatitis, or AD. People with AD develop an intensely itchy skin rash that tends to come and go over time. It can affect any part of the body, but is most common on the neck, wrists, ankles, hands and the insides of the knees and elbows. Babies and young children young children with AD usually develop a rash on their faces and scalps. | AD isn’t contagious, and it’s usually not dangerous in itself. However, the intense itching makes it very uncomfortable to live with. Scratching the rash only intensifies the inflammation and can also cause complications like skin infections. Over time, scratching can cause thick, discolored patches to form on the skin - a condition called neurodermatitis. In rare cases, severe eczema on the face can cause permanent damage to the eyes. Treating AD early and practicing good skin care is essential to prevent these problems from developing. | AD affects an estimated 17 million people in the United States, including about 10-20 percent of children and 1-3 percent of adults. Most cases appear before age five, and about half continue into adulthood.	"No one knows exactly what causes atopic dermatitis, but research suggests that inherited sensitivities of the skin and immune system play a role. | Some experts believe AD is related to other atopic (allergic) conditions like hay fever and asthma. About half of all people with AD eventually develop one of these conditions, and many have close family members with these allergies. | AD “flares” are usually set off by certain triggers that differ from person to person. Many substances in the environment (called irritants) can trigger a rash in susceptible people, including: | Soaps and laundry detergents
  Cigarette smoke
  Cleaning products
  Smog and environmental pollutants
  Dust or sand
  Rough fabrics (for example, wool)
  Acidic foods (for example, fruit juice)
  Skin care and products (especially those containing alcohol or fragrance). | Other possible triggers include: | Stress
  Hormonal changes
  Dry skin
  Sweating
  Hot weather
  Extreme humidity (both high and low)
  Infections. | There’s evidence that AD flare-ups can be worsened by allergies, which are sensitivities to environmental substances like foods, pollen, pets, and dust mites. Exposure causes the allergic person’s immune system to respond as it would to a dangerous substance like bacteria. Immune cells rush to the skin and release inflammatory chemicals that cause swelling, itching and redness."	" | The AD rash varies from person to person, and can even look different on different body parts of the same person. Common signs include: | Patches of discolored skin that range from red to grayish-brown. The rash may appear suddenly.
  Itching, which may be quite intense, especially at night.
  Little raised bumps that may ooze fluid or crust over.
  Patches of scaly, thickened, or leathery skin.
  Raw or sensitive spots caused by scratching. | Atopic dermatitis usually recurs in flare-ups with symptom-free periods in between. These “remissions” can last weeks, months, or even years."	"Some eczema flares can be treated at home, but see a doctor if: | You notice AD symptoms for the first time.
  The condition interferes with your normal activities.
  You’re having trouble sleeping.
  The rash is painful.
  You think your skin may be infected.
  You have severe rash around the eyes or swelling of the eyelids. | AD is usually diagnosed by history and physical examination. There is no definitive test for the condition. Allergy tests (blood tests, scratch tests) are sometimes used to identify potential triggers. | If AD is suspected, your physician may refer you to a dermatologist or allergist for specialized diagnosis and treatment. | At present, there is no cure for atopic dermatitis. The goals of treatment are to relieve discomfort, prevent complications and minimize future flares. | The best thing people with AD can do for their condition is to practice good skin care. Not only does it help prevent flares, it makes all other treatments more effective. Some essential skin care steps: | Take regular warm (not hot) baths.
  Cleanse your skin gently with a mild soap. Do not scrub.
  After getting out, pat your skin dry with a soft towel.
  Apply a good moisturizer within a few minutes of exiting the water. | Mild AD rash sometimes responds to over-the-counter creams and antihistamines like Benadryl. In more severe cases, your doctor may prescribe: | Astringents - topical medicines that cleanse the skin and help prevent infection.
  Corticosteroid creams and ointments - powerful anti-inflammatory medicines that provide short-term relief from redness and itching.
  Antibiotics - used to treat bacterial skin infections. Your doctor may also recommend a longer course of therapy in order to reduce overall bacteria levels on your skin.
  Oral antihistamines - help to relieve itching. They also cause drowsiness, which can be helpful if you’re having trouble sleeping.
  Oral/injected corticosteroids - like the topical forms, these drugs are very effective at reducing swelling and itching. Because long-term use can cause potentially serious side effects like high blood pressure and osteoporosis, they’re usually only used for short periods to treat severe discomfort.
  Immunomodulators - decrease the amount of inflammatory chemicals released by the immune system. Because of the potential for side effects, they’re only used in severe cases when other treatments don’t work. | Some people find that exposing the skin to natural sunlight or ultraviolet lamp light helps their AD rash. Unfortunately, ultraviolet radiation also carries serious health risks, including drying and aging of the skin and increased risk for skin cancer. Your doctor can help you decide if light therapy is right for you, and if so, what precautions to take. | Another thing you can do to help manage your AD is to avoid triggers when possible. Try to avoid getting overheated, manage stress, wear loose clothing and choose skin products designed for sensitive skin or labeled “hypoallergenic.” | The good news about AD is that it tends to improve with age and often disappears by the teenage or young adult years. However, about half of all kids with AD continue to have flares into adulthood. | People who had AD as a child have a lifelong tendency toward dry skin and remain more susceptible to skin problems like staph and herpes virus infections. They may also be at increased risk for eye problems like cataracts."	"Because atopic dermatitis is probably a genetic condition, there’s no way to prevent it. However, if you do have AD, take these steps to help prevent flares and complications: | Establish a skin care routine. Regularly apply a moisturizer with an ointment base (like petrolatum) to help relieve skin dryness and prevent cracking.
  When bathing, use warm water and mild soap and scrub the skin gently.
  Know the signs of skin infection and seek treatment promptly if they appear.
  Practice positive stress management. Time management, exercise, mind-body practices, and talking to a friend are all positive ways to deal with emotions. A good counselor or psychologist can also help.
  Find ways to decrease scratching. Some people scratch less when their hands are busy with an activity or when they surround themselves with others.
  Use makeup and sunscreen designed especially for people with sensitive skin."	"“Atopic Dermatitis.” American Academy of Dermatology, 2014. http://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/diseases-and-treatments/a—d/atopic-dermatitis. Accessed July 10, 2014.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/impetigo	Impetigo is a skin infection caused by bacteria, resulting in a red rash, blisters, and a characteristic honey-colored crust on the skin. Impetigo most commonly occurs in infants and children age 2 to 6. | There are three forms of impetigo:	"Impetigo is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. This highly contagious infection is spread from one person to the next by direct contact with the lesions or secretions of an infected person. The condition occurs on areas of skin where a person has a pre-existing scratch, cut or break in the skin through which the bacteria can enter. |  | Risk factors include: | Young age (infants and young children)
  Warm temperatures or summer season
  Crowded environment
  Contact sports, such as wrestling or football
  Breaks in the skin."	"Typically an individual with impetigo experiences the onset of symptoms within 1 to 3 days after acquiring the infection. The initial symptom of impetigo is a red rash, usually located on the face, arms or legs. | Nonbullous impetigo typically causes a rash on the face around the mouth and nose. The rash begins as small red pimples (papules). The infection progresses to form small fluid-filled blisters or lesions filled with pus (pustules). After several days, the blisters and pustules rupture and weep, forming the classic honey-colored crusts.
  Bullous impetigo is associated with larger fluid-filled blisters, pustules, and honey-colored crusts that often affect the diaper area and trunk.
  Ecthyma is a severe form of impetigo associated with deep punched-out ulcers, which extend into the dermis, and a honey-colored crust. | Complications | Severe forms of impetigo may lead to the following major complications: | Cellulitis, a widespread bacterial skin infection, affects surrounding areas and tissues beneath the dermis. In extreme cases of cellulitis, bacteria enter the bloodstream, resulting in a life-threatening illness.
  Kidney damage and impaired kidney function may occur with streptococcal forms of impetigo.
  Permanent scarring may result from ecthyma because of deep skin involvement."	"Impetigo is usually diagnosed by visually observing the characteristic skin rash with honey-colored crust, so, in most cases, there is no need for additional testing. Sometimes, the fluid from weeping areas is tested in a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis and identify the bacteria involved. | Left untreated, the infection normally resolves itself in approximately 3 weeks. However, treatment with medication clears the infection much faster. | Treatment includes the following: | Topical antibiotic ointment applied externally to the skin treats mild cases of impetigo with few blisters. A prescription strength medication (Mupirocin ointment) is more effective than over-the-counter topical antibacterial products.
  Oral antibiotics are prescribed for more severe skin infections with large, widespread lesions. Commonly prescribed oral antibiotics include cephalexin, dicloxacillin, and erythromycin.
  Antibacterial soap helps clean the affected skin."	Impetigo is highly contagious and easily transmitted to others through contact with infected skin, shared objects, clothing and linens. The best way to prevent impetigo is to avoid contact with infected people and contaminated objects. Hand washing is considered vital in reducing the spread of infections. Additionally, the infection is only acquired when there is a break or cut on the skin, so children should be taught to avoid scratching, and their fingernails should be kept properly trimmed. After 48 hours of antibiotic treatment, a person with impetigo is no longer contagious.	"Lawley LP, McCall CO, Lawley TJ. Chapter 52.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/molluscum-contagiosum	Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral skin infection that causes benign lesions or “bumps” on the skin. The lesions are white, pink or flesh colored, and have a dip in the center. They are pearly in appearance, firm to the touch and range in size from two millimeters (i.e., pinhead) to five millimeters (i.e., pencil eraser) in diameter. Molluscum contagiosum is a contagious disease and can spread through direct contact with the skin of an infected person, or a contaminated surface. |  | Molluscum contagiosum is mostly observed in children, but can affect adults, in particular those with a compromised immune system. The lesions form anywhere on the body, but are uncommon on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. While the average person may see 10-20 lesions, the number increases significantly (more than 100) in those with compromised immunity, for example HIV/AIDS patients. | In otherwise healthy individuals, the disease clears up within 6-12 months. Topical treatment or surgical removal of the lesions may be recommended in order to prevent spread of the virus. Picking or surgical removal of the lesions may leave scars. Open lesions also carry the risk of secondary infection by bacteria.	"Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus, the family of large DNA viruses that include smallpox and monkeypox. This virus lives in the skin lesions and can spread in two ways: | Risk factors for molluscum contagiosum include the following: | Age: Molluscum contagiosum is most common in children between 1-10 years of age.
  Poor immunity: AIDS, cancer therapy, and other circumstances that weaken the immune system increase the likelihood of an infection. In fact, a severe form of molluscum contagiosum, which is recognized by an increase in size and frequency of lesions, is often the sign of an undiagnosed HIV infection.
  Atopic dermatitis: Eczema causes breaks in the skin, making it more prone to infection as well as self-re-infection.
  Climate: The molluscum contagiosum virus easily spreads in crowded environments with a warm, humid climate.
  Geography: The incidence of molluscum contagiosum is higher in developing countries."	"Painless bumps on the skin’s surface are the main symptom associated with molluscum contagiosum. In children, they are found in all areas of the body, including the face, neck, armpits, arms and tops of the hands. In adults, the virus is commonly transmitted via sexual contact and is often found on the genitals, thighs and lower abdomen. The bumps appear roughly seven weeks following exposure to the virus and display the following features: | Small, firm bumps that are between 2-5 millimeters in diameter
  White, pink or flesh colored with a waxy (pearly) appearance
  Indentation or dimple in the center, filled with a waxy substance
  May itch
  Can spread to unaffected skin if scratched or picked off
  Become red or inflamed as the immune system fights the virus
  Are large in size (more than15 millimeters in diameter) and number (more than 100) when the host immune system is compromised (e.g., patients with HIV/AIDS)."	"Molluscum contagiosum is diagnosed by visual inspection of the lesions. If necessary, a scraping from the lesion is analyzed by microscopy to verify the diagnosis. | The molluscum contagiosum lesions usually clear on their own over the course of 6-12 months, at which point the patient is no longer contagious. Intervention is rarely used in pediatric patients due to the risk of adverse reactions. However, in adults and those with compromised immune systems, the lesions are often treated in order to prevent further spread. The treatment options depend on the patient’s overall health and the frequency and location of lesions. | Topical treatment: Topical creams and ointments are applied to each lesion, often repeatedly for several weeks until all lesions are treated. Imiquimod treats the lesion by triggering a local immune response. Topical creams containing retinoids, or solutions with skin irritants (e.g., salicylic acid or potassium hydroxide) are also used to destroy the lesions.
  Surgery: Surgical methods remove the lesions by freezing with liquid nitrogen (cryosurgery), physical scraping (curettage) or laser (laser surgery). These procedures are performed under local anesthesia and can leave scars.
  Oral treatments: Oral cimetidine is used as a systemic treatment in some pediatric patients. Unlike the topical creams and surgery, this approach is pain-free and does not cause scarring.
  Combination therapy: Immunocompromised patients do not respond well to routine treatments for molluscum contagiosum and require a combination of approaches. Treatments aimed at boosting the immune system have been most effective. Laser removal and some topical treatments are also used."	"Infection with molluscum contagiosum does not provide immunity to future re-infection. The following are effective ways to prevent transmission of molluscum contagiosum. | Wash your hands
  Cover the lesions
  Avoid scratching or picking of the lesions
  Avoid swimming unless the lesions are covered with water-tight bandages
  Avoid contact sports unless all lesions are covered
  Avoid shaving, combing and other activities that irritate the lesions
  Do not share personal items including toiletries, clothes, linens and towels."	"“Molluscum contagiosum”. Mayo Clinic. Retrieved Jan. 6, 2016. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/molluscum-contagiosum/basics/definition/con-20026391.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/psoriasis	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, in which the skin produces new skin cells too quickly. Normally, in a process called turnover, the lowest level of the epidermis produces new skin cells that rise to the outermost layer of the skin in a period of one month. In psoriasis, rapid turnover occurs in only a few days. In the most common forms of psoriasis, excess skin cells accumulate on the skin surface, resulting in thick patches (plaques) of reddened, inflamed skin covered with silvery white scales. | This disease usually develops in individuals between the ages of 15 to 30 years. Psoriasis is a life-long condition, erupting at unpredictable intervals, alternating with periods of remission.	" | The underlying cause of psoriasis is unknown. However, research has established that psoriasis is the result of a malfunction of the immune system, in which certain white blood cells (termed T cells) mistakenly attack the skin, triggering inflammation and rapid skin cell turnover. | Risk factors for the development of psoriasis include the following: | Genetics (psoriasis often runs in families)
  Streptococcal throat infection
  Skin injury
  Stress
  Certain medications
  Smoking
  Obesity."	"Individuals with psoriasis usually develop raised red plaques with silvery white scales, associated with itching and pain. Reddened skin beneath the plaques easily bleeds when the scales are removed. Plaques can range from tiny spots to extensive eruptions across large areas. | Typically, psoriasis erupts symmetrically, but unilateral symptoms can occur. Affected areas usually include the extensor surface of the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, buttocks and genital area. Commonly, nails appear thickened, pitted and deformed. | Symptoms are characterized by cycles of worsening (flares) for weeks or months followed by periods of improvement or even complete remission. Additionally, individuals with psoriasis frequently feel self-conscious about the appearance of their skin, which can result in social isolation and depression. | Chronic Plaque Psoriasis: | Most common form of psoriasis
  Raised, red plaques with silvery, scaly surface. | Guttate Psoriasis: | Typically small sores on the trunk, extremities and scalp
  Frequently precipitated by a streptococcal bacteria throat infection
  Often self-limiting, resolving without treatment in 6-12 weeks. | Scalp Psoriasis: | Red, scaly patches on the scalp
  Commonly spreads past the hairline. | Inverse Psoriasis: | Well-demarcated areas of redness, but scaliness is absent
  Affects skin folds such as under the breasts, axilla, genital area and neck
  Obesity is a major risk factor. | Pustular Psoriasis: | Pustules (blisters filled with pus) on the trunk and extremities
  Fever
  Dehydration
  Often life-threatening
  Difficult to control and requires aggressive treatment. | Erythrodermic Psoriasis: | Least common form of psoriasis
  Red rash with scales, burning and itching across the entire body
  Often severe and difficult to control. | Psoriatic Arthritis: | Red, inflamed, scaly skin
  Nail pitting
  Swollen joints. | "	"Most cases of psoriasis are diagnosed by the patient’s symptoms and physical examination. Rarely, a skin biopsy is necessary to rule out other conditions that may resemble psoriasis. | There is no cure for psoriasis; therefore, the main goal of treatment is to slow the rapid turnover of skin cells and relieve symptoms. | In treating psoriasis, medications are applied directly to the surface of the skin. | Topical corticosteroids decrease inflammation; suppress the immune system; slow skin turnover; and decrease itching.
  Vitamin D analogs, synthetic compounds based on naturally occurring vitamin D, help decrease skin cell growth.
  Retinoids, synthetic compounds derived from vitamin A, normalize skin cell activity and decrease inflammation.
  Coal tar decreases scaling and inflammation.
  Anthralin decreases inflammation and skin cell turnover; diminishes scaliness; and smoothes the skin.
  Salicylic acid peels the skin and reduces scaliness. | Sunlight: | A natural form of ultraviolet light.
  Brief exposure reduces T cell activity and decreases scaliness.
  Prolonged exposure causes skin damage. | Ultraviolet B (UVB) Phototherapy: | A short wave ultraviolet light provided by an artificial light source.
  Useful for mild to moderate cases of psoriasis.
  Risks include burning the epidermis. | Narrowband UVB Therapy: | A newer and more effective form of UVB therapy.
  Carries a higher risk of burns. | Goeckerman Therapy: | A combination of coal tar and UVB treatment.
  Coal tar makes UVB treatment more effective. | Psoralen and Ultraviolet A (UVA) Phototherapy (PUVA): | A combination of a drug called psoralen and UVA light therapy.
  UVA is a long wave ultraviolet light that penetrates deep into the dermis.
  Psoralen makes skin more sensitive to UVA rays.
  Only used for severe cases of psoriasis.
  Increases risk for sunburns, premature aging and skin cancer. | Excimer Laser: | A form of UVB light therapy.
  Directed only at the affected skin so normal skin is not harmed. | In the case of these treatment methods, medications are administered orally or by injection for severe cases of psoriasis. | Methotrexate: | Suppresses the immune system and decreases the growth of skin cells.
  Increases the risk for liver damage and impairs the body’s ability to fight infection. | Retinoids: | Reduce the production of skin cells.
  Increase the risk of birth defects and are not to be used during pregnancy. | Cyclosporine: | Suppresses the immune system to decrease skin cell turnover.

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/scabies	Scabies is a fully treatable skin rash caused by the microscopic human mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact or by contact with infested clothing and bedding. The mites burrow into the upper skin layer (epidermis) to live and lay eggs, causing raised itchy bumps along the way. |  | The elderly and those with a weakened immune system may develop a severe form of scabies called crusted scabies, also called Norwegian scabies. Crusted scabies is highly contagious because of thick brittle crusts that form on the skin, each carrying hundreds to thousands of mites and eggs. | Mites are species-specific, which means mites that infect other animals cannot infect humans, and vice versa. Other species of mites may cause a minor skin reaction in humans, but they cannot reproduce. | Human scabies is very common worldwide and can affect anyone regardless of age, gender, race and ethnicity. It spreads easily in places where there is close human-to-human contact, such as hospitals, childcare centers, prisons and nursing homes. Scabies is fully treatable using medicated creams/lotions. The most common complication associated with scabies is infection of open sores due to excessive itching.	"Human scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Pregnant females burrow into the upper epidermis, where they lay their eggs and remain for future reproductive cycles. New mites develop and mate under the skin, then travel to the surface where they can infect a new host. In a typical infection, there are fewer than 20 mites per person and they are typically found on the hands, wrists, knees, penis, breasts and shoulder blades. The itchy skin rash that develops is caused by an allergic reaction to mite proteins, eggs and feces. | Transmission primarily takes places during prolonged, direct skin-to-skin contact (e.g. sexual contact) with an infected person. Hospitals, nursing homes and other extended care facilities are especially prone to a mite infestation. A less common means of transmission is through contact with infested clothing or linens. Crusted scabies is the most contagious form of scabies because of thick crusts on the skin that can carry thousands of mites and mite eggs. These crusts can also shelter and nourish mites for up to a week when they shed. Risk factors for acquiring scabies are: | Sexual contact with an infected partner
  Infection within the household or immediate family
  Extended care facilities (e.g. nursing homes, hospitals and childcare centers). | Risk factors for crusted scabies are: | Weakened immune system
  Advanced age."	"The most common symptoms of scabies are severe inching and body rash, which are caused by an allergic reaction to the mites. Those infected for the first time may not develop symptoms for up to two months; however, they are still contagious and able to transmit scabies. Repeat infection can produce symptoms within days. The symptoms of scabies are: | Severe itch that worsens at night
  Rash made of small bumps that look like pimples or hives
  Greyish thick crusts that easily crumble (crusted scabies). | Scabies can affect any area of the body, but mites favor the following sites: | Between fingers and around nails
  Wrists and elbows
  Buttocks and penis
  Shoulder blades and armpits
  Skin around nipples
  Skin covered with jewelry or belt. | The most common areas of infestation in young children and infants are: | Scalp, neck and face
  Palms of hands
  Soles of feet."	"Doctors diagnose scabies by examining the skin for evidence of mites and/or mite burrows. The burrows are hard to find and appear as tiny greyish or skin-colored raised lines on the skin. Scrapings from the affected skin can also be studied under a microscope to find mites or eggs. | The goal of treating scabies is to alleviate the symptoms and eliminate the parasite. Since scabies is very contagious, doctors usually recommend treatment for anyone living with the infected person, as well as recent sexual partners. Scabies is treated with prescription medications (called scabicides) that kill mites and mite eggs. In most cases adults and children can resume normal activity the day following treatment, although the itch can persist for a few more weeks. If itching and rash reappear after four weeks, retreatment is needed. Treatment for scabies includes: | Scabicides: Creams and lotions (permethrin, lindane, crotamiton) and oral ivermectin are available for treating scabies. Choice of treatment depends on the patient’s age, pregnancy, overall health and response to previous scabies drugs. Ivermectin is used to treat crusted scabies or patients with weak immune systems. Treatment lotions/creams are applied all over the body - including head, neck and scalp for children - and left for several hours.
  Decontamination: All clothing and linens belonging to the infected person must be washed in hot water. Items that cannot be laundered can be sealed in a bag for 2-3 days to kill mites and eggs.
  Antihistamine: Over-the-counter allergy medications may be used to manage the rash and itching.
  Antibiotics: Excessive itching of the rash area(s) can lead to open sores and infection. Antibiotics are prescribed to treat the infection."	Repeat infestation or a scabies outbreak can be prevented by avoiding contact with an infected person and laundering all contaminated linens and clothing in hot water. Items that cannot be washed can be sealed in a bag for 2-3 days to starve the mites.	"“Scabies”. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

https://www.innerbody.com/diseases-conditions/vitiligo	"Vitiligo is a disorder characterized by blotches of discolored skin. The blotches appear lighter in color because the underlying cells that give skin its color (melanocytes) either die or lose function. Vitiligo is commonly observed on exposed skin (e.g. face, neck, hands) but can affect any part of the body that has pigmented cells. In some cases, it may cause loss of color inside the mouth, on the eyes, and on the hair. Due to this alteration of physical appearance, it can lead to severe social and emotion anxiety. Other complications include vision or hearing difficulties and sensitivity to the sun. |  | There are two types of vitiligo: segmental and non-segmental. | Segmental vitiligo affects one segment, or side, of the body (a hand, a leg, or the face) and in 50% of individuals some hair (on head, eyebrows, eyelashes). Symptoms appear at an early age and progress for only a few years.
  Non-segmental vitiligo is more common and affects both sides of the body. It usually begins with a short-lived burst of discoloration on the hands, feet, or face. The affected areas expand with new cycles of pigment loss that occur throughout the person’s life. | The extent of pigment loss on the body is described as localized, generalized, or universal. The localized and universal subtypes describe the two extreme forms of disease - a few blotches versus pigment loss over the majority of the body, respectively. The most common subtype of vitiligo is generalized, which is characterized by scattered patches throughout the body. | In America, 1 to 2 million individuals suffer from vitiligo. This disease is not contagious or life threatening, and has been observed equally across all genders, races and ethnicities. Vitiligo is a lifelong condition that generally begins before the age of 20. There is no cure, but there are ways to minimize the appearance of skin discoloration. Popular musical figure Michael Jackson was famously known for suffering from this skin disease."	"The light/white blotches of skin associated with vitiligo form when melanocytes fail to produce melanin. It is not known what causes melanocytes to die or stop producing melanin, but the following may play a role: | Autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases occur when the body mistakenly attacks and destroys its own cells. Hyperthyroidism is one such condition that may launch an immune response against melanocytes.
  Family history. Individuals with a family history of vitiligo are more likely to inherit the genetic factors that affect melanocyte function.
  Distress. Excessive stress or exposure to sun and certain hazardous chemicals may also trigger pigment loss."	"The main symptom of vitiligo is pigment loss on the skin. The light/white blotches generally appear before the age of 20 and can vary in size and number. This condition is not associated with physical pain or discomfort. Symptoms may appear as: | Discolored skin on the face, arms, hands, or feet (most common)
  Discolored skin on other parts of the body (armpits, genitals, rectum, etc.)
  Light colored tissue along the inside of mouth and nose
  Loss of color in the hair (head, eyebrows, eyelashes, and facial hair)."	"In order to diagnose vitiligo, a physician will examine the affected skin and inquire about possible family history of the disorder. Blood tests that check for autoimmune thyroid disease or biopsies of the affected tissue may be performed. Individuals with discoloration in the eye or ear may require examination by a specialist for those organs. |  | Since no cure is available for vitiligo, the main goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of discolored skin. The safest treatment option is cosmetics. Medication, light therapy, and surgery can cause dryness, itching, and burning of the skin or more serious side effects. | Cosmetics. Applying makeup or skin tanners to the affected areas can mask minor cases of vitiligo. Although cosmetics require frequent application, they are generally safe and free of side effects.
  Medication. Topical creams that affect the immune system or control inflammation (corticosteroid) may help re-pigment the skin. These creams may be used in combination with ultraviolet light to improve results. Due to adverse reactions, these treatments are generally used for small areas on the face and neck. Those with widespread vitiligo may wish to remove pigment from the remaining unaffected areas by applying topical creams that gradually lighten the skin.
  Light therapy. Repeated courses of light therapy can help restore some color to the affected skin on the face, trunk, and limbs by triggering the skin’s natural healing process. In photochemotherapy, ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light is used in combination with a drug that makes the skin more sensitive to UV light. Alternatively, narrow band UVB light can be used alone.
  Surgery. Surgical options are available when cosmetics, medication, or light therapy do not yield desirable outcomes. Skin and blister grafting techniques involve removing pigmented skin from unaffected areas and attaching it to small areas of discolored skin. These procedures may cause scarring and change the texture of the treated areas. Pigment can also be delivered to the discolored skin via tattooing. All surgical options pose the risk of triggering pigment loss in neighboring skin. | (adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});"	Most cases of vitiligo cannot be prevented. Reducing exposure to known triggers (e.g. sun, chemicals, stress) can help prevent pigment loss in new areas of the body.	"“Vitiligo”.

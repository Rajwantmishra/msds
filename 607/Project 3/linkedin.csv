Insurtech and several other trends are transforming P&C and commercial  insurance markets today. Without being able to adapt, organizations will find themselves unable to sustain sales growth and will ultimately lose market share.

I am an IBM recognized Thought Leader and Sage Global Business Expert with an extensive background in B2B client acquisition and business development strategies. Clients hire me to accelerate growth in their commercial insurance practices today while helping them see and seize new opportunities moving forward. I have proven success increasing sales pipelines and reducing sales cycles for organizations.

For many producers, they need to change their mindset from a focus on revenue production to a sales team leader. This includes developing future successful commercial producers and creating systems to build a more valuable business.

We work with clients to develop commercial insurance producers and financial advisors. Our strength-based programs are designed to:

Increase the producers’ skills in prospecting and client acquisition
Develop a unique leadership position in their target markets
Leverage online media to create ongoing client communication channels
Coach clients on business development systems to increase revenue and profits
Help clients recruit, develop, and retain the next generation of high performing sales leaders

We develop our clients’ leaders into performance partners who can leverage their time and efforts by engaging and empowering their producers at critical points in the client development process. 
This coaching process allows newly hired producers to take advantage of the organization’s strengths and capabilities to accelerate their sales results and career success while providing insurance clients with the results that they need.

These days we need to go beyond current KPI's and measure success based on customer needs, that is both time relevant and business relevant. This is the advent of business transformation and the consumer is dictating this paradigm shift in commerce and communication across all industry sectors. 

When I started ArCompany a few years back we saw the future: taking Social Media to the inevitable next level: operationalizing social and showing companies how to capitalize on social intelligence.

The tide is turning and this vision is now a reality. I'm now tackling how business begins to transform because of AI's impetus and how this new technology will require changes to ensure ethical distribution. It will change culture, process and mindset. My belief: in order for AI to scale, we need to educate on AI impacts on privacy, policy, process, culture and jobs and provide the foundations and how they mobilize in preparation for its arrival.  

With over 18 years in the digital space, I have worked within these disciplines: AI, data analytics, big data, social media strategy, performance tracking and optimization, influencer strategy, content strategy and development, community management, application development for web and mobile, client management, search and online media strategy/marketing, product marketing, sponsorship marketing, direct and database marketing, loyalty/CRM, education, training, outreach, content management, and PR.

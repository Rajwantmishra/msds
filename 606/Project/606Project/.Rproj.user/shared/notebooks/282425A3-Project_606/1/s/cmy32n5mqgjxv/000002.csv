"0","#  Final Project Format "
"0","# 	The final report should be presented in more formal format. Consider your audience to be non data analysts. Fellow data analysts (i.e. students) will be able to access your R Markdown file for details on the analysis. Submit a Zip file with your R Markdown file, the HTML output, and any supplementary files (e.g. data, figures, etc.). You must address the five following sections:"
"0","# "
"0","# Introduction: What is your research question? Why do you care? Why should others care?"
"0","# "
"0","# Data: Write about the data from your proposal in text form. Address the following points:"
"0","# "
"0","# Data collection: Describe how the data were collected."
"0","# Cases: What are the cases? (Remember: case = units of observation or units of experiment)"
"0","# Variables: What are the two variables you will be studying? State the type of each variable."
"0","# Type of study: What is the type of study, observational or an experiment? Explain how you've arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design."
"0","# Scope of inference - generalizability: Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not. Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability."
"0","# Scope of inference - causality: Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not."
"0","# Exploratory data analysis: Perform relevant descriptive statistics, including summary statistics and visualization of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question."
"0","# "
"0","# Inference: If your data fails some conditions and you can't use a theoretical method, then you should use simulation. If you can use both methods, then you should use both methods. It is your responsibility to figure out the appropriate methodology."
"0","# "
"0","# Check conditions"
"0","# Theoretical inference (if possible) - hypothesis test and confidence interval"
"0","# Simulation based inference - hypothesis test and confidence interval"
"0","# Brief description of methodology that reflects your conceptual understanding"
"0","# Conclusion: Write a brief summary of your findings without repeating your statements from earlier. Also include a discussion of what you have learned about your research question and the data you collected. You may also want to include ideas for possible future research."
